Introduction VisitCopenhagen.com and the connected social media channels under the same brand are owned and run by Wonderful Copenhagen, the official tourist organization in the Copenhagen region. All content on VisitCopenhagen and its social media channels is editorial, chosen and written by our editorial staff in alignment with Wonderful Copenhagen\u2019s strategy and VisitCopenhagen\u2019s communication strategy. Our main focus is to fulfil the travellers\u2019 needs for the benefit of the destination. Strategic reason VisitCopenhagen\u2019s communication strategy is founded on principles supporting sustainable tourism and attracting people from abroad who share the same mindset. The three main pillars of this effort are seasonal spread , geographical spread, and sustainable behaviour . On top of that, our storytelling is built around four strengths that make Copenhagen stand out, are difficult to copy for competing destinations, and that guests find attractive. Our four themes are gastronomy , outdoor city life , architecture and design , and culture and art . According to this, at least one or more of these defined strengths must be present in each component of the overall narrative we built around Copenhagen as a travel destination. Editorial freedom and independence VisitCopenhagen is run on the principle of editorial freedom. We are not paid to put certain content on the site. The editorial decisions are solely made following the strategies of Wonderful Copenhagen and VisitCopenhagen. The purpose of VisitCopenhagen.com is not to be a complete directory of things to experience in Copenhagen but to transmit a narrative that can inspire travellers and convey a rightful, authentic image of Copenhagen as a travel destination. For that reason, we reserve the right to pass on stories, points of interest, etc., even though they may align with our communication strategy. Paid content On very few sections on VisitCopenhagen.com, you will find paid content. It will always be obvious when this is the case. Replies on inquiries We reserve the right to moderate and delete comments on our social media if standard good etiquette and the media\u2019s guidelines are not respected. On our social media, we aim to answer all inquiries from people who need help solving a problem or answering a question \u2013 but often, our community beats us to it. Everyone is welcome to contact us through our contact form . You will receive an autoreply to confirm that your mail has been received. We aim to answer all requests as soon as possible, but due to limited resources, we cannot always guarantee a swift answer. Promoting events Generally, we mention more significant and annual events in the Copenhagen area, but unfortunately, we do not run an event calendar per se. Disclaimer We aim to keep the site updated according to the current strategic focus with the resources we have at our disposal. Copenhagen is an ever-evolving city, and even though we do our best to keep everything current and fresh, we acknowledge the fact that there might be content on the site that is yet to be updated according to our own standards.

But just like in any other city, you should take certain precautions. Safety in general In addition to following the official travel guidelines of your own national authorities, you can consult Danish Police here . Christiania The area is loved by many but has been a turning point for strong debate due to illegal drug dealings, which have also been subject to safety concerns for visitors. The community and authorities have worked together to improve safety and address criminal activities. (Danish legislation prohibits the dealing, buying, and possessing of illegal substances). On April 6, 2024, the residents of Christiania took a significant step by digging up the cobblestones on \u201cPusher Street\u201d. This act was a symbolic gesture to mark the end of the open drug market in the area. It is advised not to search out Christiania for any sort of illegal substances. Pickpockets love distractions Photo : Thomas Rousing Around Copenhagen Central Station you should pay extra attention to pickpockets. The area around City Hall Square and the beginning of Str\u00f8get (the pedestrian street) is very busy, and also an area to be aware of thieves. Each summer, Copenhagen Municipality, in collaboration with Copenhagen Police, run a campaign warning against pickpockets.\u00a0They use a variety of distractions and tactics to relieve victims of their personal items. Please ask yourself the following questions: Are you aware of your valuables in a crowd? Are your phone and money safely stored? When you pay with a card, do you always cover your pin code? Crowded areas Str\u00f8get , City Hall Square and Gothersgade can be crowded areas by night \u2013 especially during weekends. Fake police On a few rare occasions, tourists have been scammed by fake police officers. The victims have either paid on-the-spot fines for \"breaking the law\" or have been frisked and unknowingly robbed. If contacted by a police officer, demand to see legit identification. You can always contact the police by calling 114. In case of urgent matters, call 112. Looking for more inspiration for your trip? Check out these guides.

Mark Tanggaard Classic culture, deep-rooted history, and fresh seafood Rhea Leman came to Copenhagen in 1976, and was immediately in love with the city.

She particularly enjoys how history is present on every street in Copenhagen, and she loves to stroll through the parks and museums and indulge in delicious food in restaurants. Listen to Rhea's guide here Mark Tanggaard Winter bathing, ancient artifacts and retro coolness Justine Bell is an architect, and was educated in London. Orignally from Cape Town in South Africa, Copenhagen is very different from what she has been used to before. Here, she is close to an ocean, less rowdy than the Atlantic Ocean. The walkable and bike-friendly city, combined with the rapid change of seasons, has Justine fall in love with Copenhagen and call it her home. Listen to Justine's guide here Daniel Rasmussen Food from abroad, crispy wines and retro arcade gaming A decade ago, New York chef Nick Curtin and his Danish wife decided to move to Copenhagen, and he has been in love with the city ever since. He found coming to Denmark fascinating because it differed from his life in the United States. He states, \"Copenhagen is very international, but still very Danish!\" Living in Copenhagen has taught him many things about himself, such as how he interacts with people and how he thinks about food. He emphasises the green spaces and the international food scene, where people have come from their home country and found a space for their native foods in Copenhagen. Listen to Nicks' guide here Mark Tanggaard Deer safari, a royal hunting palace and Danish design galore Inan Isik, a Turkish fashion designer, might get Danes better than most - at least what the trends in Danish fashions are!

When he arrived, it was snowy and windy, and people were still on their bikes. Flabbergasted by the stubbornness of Danes, combined with his own passion for cycling, he knew he had to move here. For Aldo, the bike equals freedom. With freedom and the love of Copenhagen, he has found a balance that keeps him relaxed.

Copenhagen has a great art scene where Mamie quickly discovered a simple life was possible. She\u00a0says, that there is \" this kind of charm in\u00a0Copenhagen\" where life is more simple, there is more quality, the streets are clean, and where water and\u00a0height combine\u00a0with the landscape. Listen to Mamie's guide here Mark Tanggaard Adrenaline rushes and exotic food When Rosio Sanchez first came to Copenhagen, it was to work as a pastry chef for Noma; She actually heard about Noma, before she heard about Copenhagen! Now, Copenhagen is home. To her, Copenhagen is a city that \"has more or less everything\" and feels like a breath of fresh air. The walkable city with cycle paths everywhere keeps you active and as she said, \"it's is a special city that changes how you are.\" Listen to Rosio's guide here Mark Tanggaard Beer, bathing and solo traveling Laura Hall visited Copenhagen for the first time as a solo traveller. Later, she moved back and thought she would be here for two years. After six months, Laura and her husband looked at each other and decided the easy Copenhagen lifestyle was for them. She feels that Copenhagen is safe, notably for women travelling solo, and that Danes are kind and caring. And the weather?

What's the winter weather like in Copenhagen? What's the weather like in Copenhagen? The climate in Copenhagen follows the four seasons of the northern hemisphere, but temperatures can vary considerably during the year. February is generally the coldest with an average of 2 degrees Celcius and 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately, snow is not something we can guarantee each winter. When it occurs, it\u2019s typically from December until spring, but snow rarely lasts long. Temperatures in Copenhagen The average winter temperatures in Celcius in Copenhagen are (month: day \/ night): Dec: 3,7 \/ -0,5 Jan: 1,9 \/ -2,0 Feb: 2,0 \/ -2,4 Month: day \/ night (average temperatures in Fahrenheit): Dec: 38,7 \/ 31,1 Jan: 35,4 \/ 28,4 Feb: 35,6 \/ 27,7 What to wear in Copenhagen in winter? There is no bad weather, only bad clothing. In Denmark, we have a saying: \"There is no bad weather, only bad clothing.\" This couldn\u2019t be more true in winter. While temperatures may not look extreme on paper, the high humidity and biting westerly and northerly winds can make it feel much colder. Without the right clothing, exploring Copenhagen during winter can quickly become an uncomfortable experience. Layers is the key The key to staying comfortable is layering. Start with a good cotton or wool base layer that fits snugly to your body. Add a thicker, slightly looser wool sweater or fleece for insulation, and top it off with a high-quality jacket that\u2019s both waterproof and windproof. Pair this with long underwear, a cozy beanie, and you\u2019ll be ready to enjoy hours outdoors in the beautiful winter scenery of Copenhagen. Why wool? As you might have noticed, there\u2019s a recurring theme here: wool. For generations, it has been a trusted material in the Nordic region\u2014and for good reason. Wool naturally regulates temperature, keeping you warm in winter and cool in summer, making it the perfect thermal material. Plus, a classic Nordic wool jumper isn\u2019t just practical\u2014it looks fantastic too. Embrace the local style and wrap yourself head to toe in wool for both comfort and charm. What's open in the winter in Copenhagen? Restaurants, museums and shops are all open all year round, in winter you're just more likely to bump into a local than another tourist. Outdoor experiences, like canal cruises, also operate year-round, though some operate with fewer boats in the winter season, so keep that in mind. Tivoli is one exception. In winter, it\u2019s usually open only for Christmas, from mid-November to the end of December, and then remains closed until reopening for Easter in April.

Thanks to a clever video filter, your image is transformed in real time into a mysterious artwork, displayed within a beautifully framed setting.

Walking with L\u00e9on Spilliaert In 1935, L\u00e9on Spilliaert, the famed\u00a0Ostend\u00a0artist, faced a significant change in his life. He and his family were about to move to Brussels, but before saying farewell to his beloved birthplace, he took one last walk through Ostend. This journey, now brought back to life through the art walk in the Ostend City Walks app, offers a unique chance to walk through the city from Spilliaert's own perspective. Whether you\u2019re an art lover, a local from Ostend, or simply curious about Spilliaert's life, this walk offers an engaging and relatable experience for everyone. The art walk is more than a tribute to Spilliaert; it\u2019s a time-travel journey through his Ostend, where art, memory, and the city blend seamlessly into one.

What do they hope to find or feel there? The allure is timeless. Artists try to capture that feeling \u2013 their own longing, but that of others too. Ostend expanded to become the \u2018Queen of Seaside Resorts\u2019 in the 19th century and is still the place where many Belgians go to encounter the sea today. Both the E40 and the longest IC train in the country lead to it. Mu.ZEE plays a special role in this city by the sea: the museum focuses on art in Belgium from 1880 until tomorrow. The exhibition It\u2019s Sunday at sea! is not just about the appearance of the sea but, above all, what it means to people. The sea is both relaxing and spectacular. It can bring peace but also be overwhelming. Artists sometimes show it as it is, in the open. At other times, they recall it from memory, in dreamscapes or symbols. The sea gives rise to reflection and imagination. An important source of inspiration for the exhibition is the 1899 poem Vers la mer by \u00c9mile Verhaeren. This runs like a thread through the exhibition and connects the beginning of Mu.ZEE\u2019s collection \u2013 around 1880 \u2013 with the present day. From artists such as Ensor and Spilliaert to contemporary names such as Lili Dujourie. Dujourie\u2019s work Il fait dimanche sur la mer! takes its name from a line in Verhaeren\u2019s poem. It shows the sea as it is seen from an apartment with a \u2018view of the sea\u2019 \u2013 a dream for many. Seven screens show one day of the week each, captured on video. What can you see? As a visitor, you are free to make up your own mind. Everyone\u2019s experience of the sea is different. The title It\u2019s Sunday at sea! sounds cheerful and inviting \u2013 Stefan Zweig even translates it as Sunday celebration. But perhaps it also evokes another feeling, such as the languor or stillness of a Sunday. Discover what the sea means to you in the exhibition itself. About Mu.ZEE breezes out In January 2025, Mu.ZEE closed the doors of its well-known main building in Romestraat, Ostend for three years as part of an extensive renovation. During this period, Mu.ZEE will remain active, not only in its own Permekemuseum in Jabbeke and Peiremuzee in Knokke-Heist, but also in the form of exhibitions in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Drogenbos and Koksijde. In Ostend itself, during the closure Mu.ZEE has taken up residence in the stately Venetian Galleries, designed by Henri Maquet and built between 1900 and 1903. Here Mu.ZEE shows the very best of itself, that is to say: art in Belgium from 1880 until tomorrow that speaks to the imagination. On the Ostend promenade overlooking the sea, parts of the Mu.ZEE collection are on display in three areas. The gallery offers space for four consecutive thematic exhibitions, of which It\u2019s Sunday at sea! is the first. In the large hall, next to the gallery, the focus is on one work, artist, archive or ensemble. Lastly, at the back, an active depot offers a glimpse behind the scenes of museum operations and a fascinating collection. In a permanent experimental installation, Mu.ZEE is also examining and showing the influence of light on various materials for three years, thus reflecting on presentations after the reopening of Mu.ZEE in 2028. A brand new exhibition scenography for this temporary home was designed by Theo De Meyer, Laura Muyldermans and Yuichiro Onuma.

Two major axes divide the historic centre into four parts, thus creating 4 zones which together form the city centre. In each of these zones, the focus is placed on a liveable and accessible environment. Car drivers who want to go from one zone to another can do so via the Leopold II-laan, the Van Iseghemlaan, the Visserskaai or the Vindictivelaan. These measures will prevent unnecessary traffic by those seeking their way about, while ensuring everyone gets to their destination in the city centre in an easier and faster way.
