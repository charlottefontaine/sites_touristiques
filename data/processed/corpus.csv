Red prawn, nowhere to enjoy them like Barcelona From the Mediterranean to plate: the star of the season In Barcelona, red prawns arrive directly from the Catalan coast to the fish market. Renowned for their exceptional quality, intense flavour and high nutritional value , they stand out for their freshness thanks to the proximity of local fishing ports. This seasonal product , caught from June to September, is a staple of our cuisine—a star ingredient in both traditional dishes and innovative creations that enrich our local gastronomy . Five ways to cook red prawns Red prawns are one of the most versatile and tasty seasonal ingredients in Catalan cuisine. Explore their full potential through a variety of delicious preparations . Raw red prawns ✖ Preparing raw red prawns is an art that requires maximum precision and respect for the product. In dishes like sashimi or tartare , the prawns reveal their pure, fresh, high-quality essence, preserving the authentic flavour of Mediterranean seafood. Red prawns in rice dishes ✖ Brothy rice dishes with red prawns are deeply rooted in the seafaring tradition of Barcelona. Local fishermen used to prepare meals with the fruits of the sea, like suquet de peix , where the prawns added an intense flavour and a unique culinary character. Grilled red prawns ✖ Grilling red prawns is a simple technique that brings out the intense flavour of fresh seafood. With just a touch of salt and precise cooking , their firm, juicy meat reveals their full marine character—perfect for those who appreciate traditional tastes. Charcoal-grilled red prawns ✖ The heat of the embers gives the red prawns a deep, smoky flavour. The direct flame subtly caramelises the shell and concentrates their juices , in a preparation that evokes the most primitive and authentic essence of seafood cuisine. Red prawns in avant-garde cuisine ✖ Avant-garde cuisine elevates red prawns to an extraordinary sensory experience. Through technique and creativity, they are transformed into a canvas where every detail matters, resulting in innovative dishes that preserve the original essence and freshness of the seafood. Where to savour red prawns The city of Barcelona offers a wide variety of places to try seasonal red prawns . Options range from traditional seafood restaurants to modern cuisine with international touches.

An excellent choice is the Pansa Blanca wines from the Alella DO, characterised by their great freshness, floral notes and fruity aromas. Aromatic rosés with high acidity , such as the Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir blends from the Penedès DO also pair perfectly with prawns, especially when they’re prepared with garlic or grilled. If you prefer red wine, it is best to choose a young or lightly aged wine , with low tannins, so that it doesn’t overpower the flavour of the seafood. In the Pla de Bages DO you’ll find wines made from Ull de Llebre or blends with other varieties such as Cabernet Franc or Sumoll. These produce light, fresh wines with balsamic notes and aromas of red fruit and aromatic local herbs such as mint and rosemary, providing a perfectly balanced pairing with this exquisite crustacean. Near the city you’ll find three wine regions with designation of origin that are a true paradise for wine and cava lovers. Wander through the vineyards, enjoy all the experiences on offer, taste the local products, and let yourself be carried away by the stunning landscapes.",1109

You'll be able to find Christmas trees, the traditional smiley log, or tió, figures for the crib, little poopers, or caganers, and much, much more. The question is, where to start? Make sure you head for the Fira de Santa Llúcia , in front of Barcelona Cathedral. This is the city's oldest Christmas market and invites you to step inside a world of wonder and tradition. The Fira de la Sagrada Família will treat you to a picture-postcard image of Christmas that will capture your heart. At the Fira del Moll de la Fusta , you'll be able to enjoy a Christmas market by the sea, with activities, food, music and fairground attractions.

And the city's hotels also offer unique things to do: biscuit-making workshops, concerts and even open-air cinemas screening Christmas films in their original language versions with Spanish subtitles. On 5th January, the majestic big parade, the Cavalcada de Reis , transforms the streets in the city centre with floats, music, lights and fantastic characters, which fill them with colour and excitement. You can see all these activities and many more in our Christmas Agenda TRADITIONS Barcelona is a city steeped in tradition. At Christmastime, the crib is a work of art that comes to life with the figures that capture the beauty of Jesus's birth, the adoration of the Magi and the shepherds. There are cribs on display all over the city at places including the cathedral , Plaça de Sant Jaume and city hall . The tió , a funny, magical log, is a well-established part of Catalan Christmas traditions. The kids feed him throughout December and keep him warm under a blanket. On Christmas Eve , the tió rewards them for their care with presents and sweets, filling the house with Christmas cheer and magic. And if you're into sport, on 25th December you can take part in the traditional Christmas cup, the Copa de Nadal , in the old harbour, Port Vell. It's the oldest open-water swimming competition in Spain. On 31st December, it's time for the Cursa dels Nassos , the fun run named in honour of the mythical character, the Home dels Nassos (Man with the Noses), who has as many noses as there are days of the year. The following day, the first community swim of the year takes to the waters of the Mediterranean. And January is also time for the International Epiphany Hockey Tournament , a thrilling competition that attracts the world's best players. FOOD Barcelona's traditional Christmas dishes, like the hearty broth, escudella (25th December), and cannelloni (26th December) take centre stage on every table over the festive period. And when it's time for dessert, delicious turrón nougats , tubular wafers called neules , and the traditional ring cake, the tortell de Reis , accompanied with a glass of cava, create a truly memorable gastronomic experience. Make sure you don't miss out on the opportunity to enjoy traditional Catalan Christmas fare, whether it's at home with home-cooked dishes or at a special banquet at one of the restaurants and hotels that serve up festive menus for Christmas, New Year's Eve and Epiphany. GIVE THE GIFT OF BARCELONA At Christmas, the city's shops are the epitome of elegance and sophistication, showing off their windows that are adorned with all kinds of decorations. Every neighbourhood has its own retail district, decked out for the occasion to create a magical, cosy atmosphere. Barcelona's shopping centres and department stores recreate the spirit of Christmas with great originality and organise activities too. And if you're looking for that special gift, the city has the most authentic and amazing shops that will make your Christmas shopping an unforgettable experience. NEW YEAR Tick-tock, tick-tock… here we are again closing the circle and getting ready to welcome in the New Year! And there could be no better place to do it than Barcelona's Avinguda Maria Cristina, where people throng together in their hundreds to eat the traditional twelve grapes, one on each stroke of midnight, and make a New Year wish as they raise a glass of cava. And when the hands of the clock point to the eagerly awaited hour, the sky lights up with a spectacular firework display. The party continues at the city's hotels and restaurants and, the next day, you can replenish your energy levels with some churro fritters and a cup of thick hot chocolate, a sweet way to start the year with renewed energy. CAVALCADA DE REIS The Three Kings' Parade is the most magical part of the festive season in Barcelona, particularly for the kids. Seeing the look of surprise and wonder on their faces while their Majesties parade through the streets is a beautiful experience. Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar arrive in Barcelona by sea on the evening of 5th January, after a long journey by camel from the Orient, to share out joy and gifts in every home. The Three Kings parade through the streets on spectacular floats, accompanied by royal pages and fairytale characters, transforming the city into a dreamlike spectacle. On the days leading up to their arrival, the little ones can visit their workshop where the magic happens and the toys come to life. TRANSPORT Choose the most sustainable ways to get around the city during the festive season. We recommend exploring on foot, by bike or on public transport, which will provide more frequent services. Special timetable Metro - On Christmas Eve, the metro will run until 11pm. On Christmas Day and 26th December the metro will run from 5am until midnight.

Barcelona Winter Walk 10 things to do where walking is the 11th Barcelona does not ascribe to the old cliché that culture in winter has to be experienced indoors. Here, museums and theatres engage in a dialogue with sunny streets and a mild climate. Discover 10 things to do so you can enjoy the city like a living cultural tapestry. ""Miró and the United States"" - Fundació Joan Miró ✖ ""Miró and the United States"" - Fundació Joan Miró 10/10/2025 - 22/02/2026 One of the most influential artists of the twentieth century meets the most influential country of the same period. This is a story of reciprocity, art and mutual impact. An individual story with a global resonance, which allows us to understand and reimagine the past, present and future of Western art. Through key works and correspondence, this exhibition, which is part of the Barcelona Art Season, explores for the first time the relationship between Miró and the United States, alongside works by more than forty artists brought together in Barcelona in this unique and unrepeatable show. Get your tickets here A classical music concert - Palau de la Música Catalana ✖ A classical music concert - Palau de la Música Catalana 19/12/2025 Barcelona’s Palau de la Música Catalana is a Catalan Art Nouveau jewel and UNESCO World Heritage icon, hailed by contemporaries for its daring design, symbolism, and lavish decoration—perhaps nothing in the city has surpassed it. Every detail is unique; step inside and experience it for yourself. This winter is the perfect moment, especially on December 19, when the hall hosts a one-day-only performance of J. S. Bach’s Christmas Oratorio, a sublime way to feel Christmas in Barcelona through its biblical scenes. Beyond the Palau, Barcelona shines as a classical-music capital in winter: L’Auditori presents major symphonic programs and choral recitals, and the Gran Teatre del Liceu ranks among Europe’s great opera houses. Together, the three venues unite under Barcelona Obertura, which promotes the city internationally and curates themed concert seasons. The result is a citywide season of world-class classical music. Buy your tickets on the website of Palau de la Música A single-artist museum - Museu Tàpies ✖ A single-artist museum - Museu Tàpies At the Museu Tàpies, art and thought are inseparable. The collection is not just a display of top-quality works, but a reflection of the artist’s ideas, inviting visitors to engage with his vision as well as his practice. Its home, the former Montaner i Simón publishing house designed by Domènech i Montaner, creates a dialogue of its own, where architectural tradition meets artistic radicalism. Current exhibitions extend this conversation, such as the unconventional and lyrical works by André du Colombier. And Barcelona is unique in this respect: it is the only city in the world where three giants of modern art – Picasso, Miró and Tàpies – have a museum dedicated to their legacy. Buy your tickets on the website of Museu Tàpies ""Michelangelo Antonioni and Luigi Ghirri"" - Palau de la Virreina ✖ ""Michelangelo Antonioni and Luigi Ghirri"" - Palau de la Virreina 31/10/25 - 15/02/2026 A free exhibition bringing together Antonioni’s photographic series The Enchanted Mountains and Ghirri’s works from the 1970s. A way of embracing nature through imagination and abstraction.Two artists who never met. Two bodies of work that speak in silence. Michelangelo Antonioni, filmmaker of the invisible, and Luigi Ghirri, photographer of the overlooked. Both discovered beauty in the fleeting details of ordinary life. Their images are not spectacles but invitations to observe, to remember, to pause. A dialogue unfolds between imagination, memory and nature. As Georges Perec suggested, it is in what happens when nothing seems to happen that we uncover the deepest truths. That is precisely what Ghirri and Antonioni sought to reveal. And this exhibition makes it clear for an audience that values aesthetic experiences which defy haste and superficiality. ""L'elisir d'amore"" - Gran Teatre del Liceu ✖ ""L'elisir d'amore"" - Gran Teatre del Liceu 22/11/2025 - 15/12/2025 Barcelona is strengthening its bond with one of the greatest composers of all time: Gaetano Donizetti. The Italian master, who is one of the most performed composers in the history of the Liceu, returns with L’Elisir d’amore, reinterpreted and given a modern reworking by Mario Gas. A fresh retelling of the opera with intelligent humour, which is perfect for a wide audience, staged in one of Europe’s most beautiful and historic opera houses. Buy your tickets on the website of Gran Teatre del Liceu A design museum - DHub Barcelona ✖ A design museum - DHub Barcelona At DHub Barcelona, design, art and innovation converge. Located in a striking building in Plaça de les Glòries, it bridges past and future through iconic collections and contemporary explorations of creativity. As the home of the city’s design museum, the Museu del Disseny, DHub preserves and displays fashion, graphics, product design and crafts, inviting visitors to experience Barcelona through a creative lens. Beyond exhibitions, it fosters talent and ideas with talks, festivals and awards, making the city a living showcase of design, culture and innovation. DHub is Barcelona’s key venue for the recognition and promotion of its creative industries. Compra les teves entrades a la web del DHUB Seasonal food to enjoy - Escudella ✖ Seasonal food to enjoy - Escudella When it comes to traditional dishes, we know what we’re talking about. Escudella i carn d’olla is the name of Europe’s first documented soup dish. And what could be a better companion on your journey into the real Barcelona than a seasonal recipe rooted in the land and its people? Once a daily meal for Catalans, this broth of meat, sausage and winter vegetables gradually acquired near-mythical status until it became the dish of choice for our Christmas celebrations. It is still served today at our traditional restaurants that still brighten winter nights with the very same recipe that once delighted our ancestors, as well as in haute-cuisine establishments that reinterpret it with contemporary flair. Seek it out, you won’t be disappointed. Discover all of Barcelona’s food and drink options here A local gift - Artisan nougat ✖ A local gift - Artisan nougat Eight hundred years ago, King Jaume I of Aragon asked the chefs who had cemented the reputation of Catalan cuisine in medieval Europe to create a delicious and indulgent sweet treat to end his daughter’s wedding banquet in style in keeping with their royal status. The result was a confection of almonds, honey and egg known in Catalonia as ""torró"". As the years went by, it became Catalonia’s quintessential Christmas treat and was no longer just found on the tables of kings and nobles. Today, you can enjoy turró in its most traditional form or in the amazing different varieties created by cutting-edge confectioners and chefs, making it a meeting point between centuries of tradition and the creativity of contemporary food. You’ll find it at the city’s most traditional and unique patisseries – such as Foix de Sarrià, La Colmena or Mauri – as well as at specialist turró shops, like Vicens and La Campana. Find an original gift here A magical tradition - The Three Kings' Parade ✖ A magical tradition - The Three Kings' Parade 05/01/2026 On January 5, Barcelona immerses itself in one of its most magical traditions: the Cavalcada de Reis. The arrival of the Three Wise Men fills the city with expectation and wonder, as children await the gifts that mark the end of the festive season. The kings come ashore in the port before going on a spectacular parade through the streets on ornate floats, accompanied by music, dancers and a cascade of sweets. More than a children’s tradition, it is a spectacle that captivates both young and old. An Art Nouveau running circuit ✖ Un circuit de running modernista Imagine logging each mile while following the flowing contours of Casa Batlló, passing the Casa de les Punxes with its distinctive pointed turrets and the iconic outline of the Sant Pau Modernisme Site. Curated by us, this running route winds through the heart of the city and its modernista architecture, transforming every stride into a journey through art, history and design. Every landmark encourages you to keep moving, discovering the city’s beauty step by step and blending fitness with a truly immersive cultural experience.

Project a Black Planet: The Art and Culture of Panafrica - MACBA Barcelona Art Season , Exhibitions 11/06/2025 - 04/06/2026 ··· MACBA presents Project a Black Planet: The Art and Culture of Panafrica , an international exhibition that explores the cultural manifestations of Pan-Africanism from the 1920s to the present day. Through more than 350 pieces by around a hundred artists from 80 countries in Africa, America and Europe, this exhibition explores the influence this movement has had on the fine arts, music, literature and politics. Co-produced with the Art Institute of Chicago and in collaboration with the Kanal Pompidou in Brussels and the Barbican Centre in London, the exhibition has a remarkable scope and ambition, offering a structured journey around key concepts such as blackness, spirituality and the interdependence of generations and geographies. It focuses on cultural responses to colonialism, slavery and racial discrimination, highlighting the ideas of solidarity and liberation as the cornerstones of Pan-Africanism.

You can't just mix for the sake of mixing; you have to mix with mathematical rigour and in-depth knowledge. If you want to visit some of the city's shrines to cocktails, keep on reading, sit at the bar and watch how the cocktail waiters in their uniforms perform magic in their laboratories. 123 On the vermouth trail: discover some of the best places to have an aperitif BCN Life , Food & Drink Do you want to feel like a true Barcelonian?

The archaeological remains found not far from the city – which provided some of the earliest evidence of brewing beer in Europe – bear this out. During the time of the Iberians, cereals were one of their staple foodstuffs and, as a result, beer was part of their everyday diet. With the arrival of the Romans, wine replaced beer, which lost its prominence for several centuries. However, in the 19th century, the city underwent a true brewing boom as a result of the beer-making know-how brought in by a group of European exiles. Two of the city's biggest brewing brands – Damm and Moritz – were born during this period and a number of craft breweries sprung up in the city center. Today, the beverage is firmly rooted in the city's gastronomic culture, to such an extent that Barcelona is now known around the world for the quality of its beer . Grain, most commonly malted barley, is the main ingredient in beer, although it can also be made from other cereals. The malting process makes the grain germinate and the process is then halted by drying and roasting the grain before fermentation begins. From this point on, the brewers can give free rein to their creativity, and many other ingredients can be added to give the beer aroma and flavour. The world's great beer styles, such as IPA , lager , stout , tripel and amber , are defined by their organoleptic, historical and cultural characteristics. There are different styles of beer – German, Belgian, English and American – associated with their country of origin. We invite you to discover and try the city's wealth of beer and food!

""Passages"" Cristina Iglesias. ""Passages"" Barcelona Art Season , Exhibitions 10/09/2025 - 01/25/2026 ··· La Pedrera offers a unique opportunity to delve into the sensory and poetic universe of Basque artist Cristina Iglesias . Known for her ability to create immersive environments, the artist uses a sculptural language that fuses architecture, literature, psychology and geology, among other disciplines, transforming it into highly poetic material. The exhibition presents a series of works ranging from suspended pavilions, labyrinths and corridors to murals infused with text, combining natural and fictional forms. Iglesias’s installations blur the boundaries between the organic and the artificial, the interior and the exterior, and become an invitation to explore space through the memory of landscape and the subterranean. For this exhibition, Iglesias has designed a proposal that establishes an architectural-sculptural dialogue, connecting the organic nature of the natural world with the strict geometry of architecture, something very present in Gaudí’s work. The exhibition route follows a pattern of movement through the fluid spaces of the modernist architect’s design, creating a dynamic interaction between the physical attributes of the artwork and the viewer’s observation. Additionally, some of her large-scale installations, such as Rooms and Passages, will be on display along with a selection of two-dimensional works.

It is one of the main hubs of community life in the area. The architect Antoni Rovira i Trias won the competition launched by Barcelona City Council to design the market and it opened in 1888 to supply the local residents, in what was then the most heavily populated part of the Eixample.

It was the first market built outside the city walls because the Boqueria, the Born and Santa Caterina couldn't keep up with the demand for food in the late 19th century. A major refurbishment project began in 2007 and major archaeological finds were uncovered that have now been incorporated into the structure.

Catalonia is a gastronomic paradise, where Catalan cuisine is a mouthwatering blend of heritage, produce, terroir, tradition, creativity, innovation… All of these things, together with an endless love of fine-dining culture, make discovering it with your palate a truly appealing option. Catalonia's gastronomic heritage can be traced back to medieval times and is still based on the value of produce and terroir stemming from locally sourced, seasonal ingredients that reflect the vast wealth of the Catalan landscape: the sea, the mountains, vegetable gardens, orchards and woodland… This tradition has given rise to such popular recipes as escudella i carn d'olla, a type of pot au feu, and a chargrilled vegetable salad known as escalivada, to name just two of the typical dishes that bring  the wealth of our produce to your plate.  Produce brought in daily to all the city's food markets and a key ingredient of the Mediterranean Diet, which was awarded Intangible Cultural Heritage status by UNESCO in 2010. And, in addition to the exquisite and varied traditional historic recipes, we have to add the creative signature cuisine that has put many of our restaurants at the forefront of cuisine around the world.

Miró knew the site well because it was located close to number 4, Passatge del Crèdit, the house where he was born in 1893. People coming to Barcelona by air are welcomed by another work by Miró: a large ceramic mural that decorates the wall of Terminal B, created in 1970 in association with the ceramicist Josep Llorenç Artigas . Here, the use of primary colours and shapes related to the world of dreams are unmistakable. And the same is true of the sculpture Dona i Ocell (Woman and Bird), which has stood since 1983 in the reflecting pool in the Parc de Joan Miró , named after the artist a few months before his death. However, it is the Fundació Miró , which opened in 1975 in a magnificent building designed by Josep Lluís Sert, where you can gain the greatest insight into Miró's work in Barcelona: valuable sculptures, tapestries, ceramics and paintings which make this museum a must. art culture espai singular exhibitions Miró museums park Woman and Bird, Joan Miró Fundació Joan Miró (Joan Miró Museum) Mural de l'Aeroport de Barcelona Parc de Joan Miró Pla de l'Os You may be also interested Skip the line!

Alfred Jarry and the Arts - Museu Picasso Barcelona Art Season , Exhibitions 11/27/2025 - 04/05/2026 ··· The Museu Picasso in Barcelona presents Ubú the Painter. Alfred Jarry and the Arts , an exhibition that examines the influence and impact of Alfred Jarry's work on art and literature from the end of the 19th century through to the present day. A careful selection of works by contemporary artists as well as later figures, including David Hockney, Robert Wilson and William Kentridge, allows the exhibition to highlight the connections between this French playwright and creators from his inner circle, such as Henri Rousseau, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec and Joan Miró. Jarry, creator of the iconic Ubu Roi in 1896, profoundly influenced the avant-garde of the 20th century. His satirical and provocative vision inspired movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism, which saw in him a pivotal figure when it came to breaking with established norms. The exhibition traces this impact through paintings, engravings and documents that reveal how his legacy lives on in contemporary art. An exhibition that merges theater, literature and visual arts, celebrating Jarry as a forerunner of modern thought and an influential cultural agitator. agenda art exhibitions Picasso Contact www.museupicassobcn.cat Museu Picasso Carrer de Montcada, 15-23, 08003 Barcelona How to get there L4-Jaume I 47, 120, H14, V15, V17, V19 Pla de Palau-Parc de la Ciutadella/Zoo Horari Tuesday to Sunday, from 10am to 7pm. | Closed: January 1st, May 1st, June 24th and December 25th.

Discover Barcelona's most iconic hotels 07/10/2022 ··· Can you picture yourself sleeping in the same hotel as Ernest Hemingway or Frank Sinatra? Or staying in the former headquarters of the Cotton Textile Foundation Fundación Textil Algodonera ? Or having breakfast in the same place as the Spanish royal family at the beginning of the 20th century? Well, in Barcelona, you can do all these things and many more. The city's historic and Landmark hotels have plenty of stories to tell. Enchanting places steeped in history, they are sure to make your stay an unforgettable experience. Do you want to find out more about them? Experience Barcelona's exclusive architecture from the inside There's no denying that Barcelona has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world. Its streets are a wonderful blend of the old and new, the medieval and art nouveau, the cutting edge and traditional. Can you imagine being able to spend some time inside this stunning heritage? Well you can, if you choose one of the city's historic or Landmark hotels. Gran Hotel Central: pure 1920's style Built in 1920 by the architect Alfons Florensa for the Catalan politician Francesc Cambó, the Gran Hotel Central will make you feel like a character from The Great Gatsby . Sophisticated and elegant, it retains the same mouldings, friezes and cornices from the Roaring Twenties, just like the ones you would find in Chicago skyscrapers. The terrace has a garden designed by Nicolas Forestier, the landscape architect who co-designed the gardens on Montjuïc for the 1929 International Exhibition, with Rubió y Tudurí. The hotel is situated on the central avenue, Via Laietana, and was one of the first buildings in Barcelona to have a lift. Gran Hotel La Florida: luxury high in the hills An imposing white building with distinctive corner towers, the Gran Hotel la Florida was built in 1924 on mount Tibidabo and, as you can imagine, boasts spectacular views of the city. It was the brainchild of the pharmaceutical magnate Doctor Andreu, who wanted to build the best hotel in Barcelona. And when his dream came true, it surpassed his wildest expectations. This luxury boutique hotel has had a chequered history but was reborn in all its glory in the 1950s. Famous personalities like Ernest Hemingway, James Stewart, Rock Hudson and Princess Fabiola have looked at the beautiful views through its picture windows. Are you going to be the next person to enjoy them? Hotel 1898. There's nothing so sweet as a room for two . Anniversary Song, Jaime Gil de Biedma. In 1881, the Catalan architect, Josep Oriol Mestres , built a mansion for the family of the Marquis of Comillas. Fortunately, you don't have to be a marquis to stay there now, because it has been transformed into the Hotel 1898 . In 1929, the building became the headquarters of the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas . The poet, Jaime Gil de Biedma, worked for the company as general secretary and his office is now one of the hotel lounges. The hotel stands right in the city centre, on the famous Rambla, and its colonial style will inspire you almost as much as the distinguished poet who was part of the group of writers known as the 50's generation . Cotton House Hotel: wrap yourself in cotton wool You'll feel like a film star when you walk up its imposing marble steps or elegant spiral staircase. Housed in a 19th-century neo-classical-style building, the Cotton House Hotel was once the headquarters of the cotton manufacturers' guild, the Fundación Textil Algodonera . In 2015, it reopened after a large-scale refit by the prestigious interior designer Lázaro Rosa-Violán, who gave it a colonialist and sophisticated look. Hotel Duquesa de Cardona. Live like a king Who said you couldn't travel back in time? This hotel dates from the 16th century, when it was the home of the aristocratic Cardona family. Their luxury home provided a refuge for the Spanish king and queen when they visited the city. In 1850, the building was extended in the neo-classical style, and its sumptuous décor, full of details, textures, prints, mouldings, marbles, mirrors and velvets, bears witness to its aristocratic past. Would you like to spend a few days living like a king? Hotel El Palace. If walls could talk El Palace is one of the buildings that best reflect the history of the city. It was the brainchild of the Catalan politician Francesc Cambó, who wanted Barcelona to have a world-class hotel. In the 1920s, a group of eminent Catalans joined forces to bring the project to fruition. Since then, the crème de la crème of society from Spain and abroad have graced its rooms, which also provided a meeting point for artists and intellectuals throughout the 20th century. Do you want to know a few curious facts? The original lamps have protected status and it has Roman style baths. In the 1940s and 1950s, major film and music stars like Ava Gardner, John Wayne, Ella Fitzgerald, Bernard Hilda, Josephine Baker and Frank Sinatra stayed at the hotel, when it was known as the Ritz . It continued to attract celebrities and Dalí made it his home for a time. Personalities like Woody Allen, Pablo Picasso, Carolina Herrera, Josep Pla, Ken Follet, Camilo José Cela and Rafael Alberti have stayed here. Wouldn't you like to walk along the same corridors and relax in the same rooms as they did? Landmark Hotels: a unique accolade The Barcelona Hotel Association has created the Landmark Hotel label to recognise hotels that bring added value to the city's architectural heritage. Here's a small sample of the 18 you'll find in the city: Claris Hotel & Spa GL. Stay among works of art Housed in a stunning former mansion, the Palau Vedruna, this hotel is a treasure in its own right. Built in 1883 in the neo-classical style, its interior is full of period detail: materials, mouldings, hand-painted frescos, gilded stucco work… 
And this interest in beauty is still there today, because all the rooms at the Claris Hotel & Spa are filled with works of art. It also houses one of the biggest collections of pre-Columbian art. If you're staying there, keep your eyes peeled: you'll be able to sit on 18th-century English furniture, walk on Turkish kilim rugs, surround yourself with Egyptian engravings commissioned by Napoleon, and works by the Catalan artist Josep Guinovart. Hotel España. A Catalan art nouveau gem The Fonda España opened in 1859. At the beginning of the 20th century, the famous Catalan art nouveau architect, Domènech i Montaner carried out a major refurbishment of the building, which was renamed the Hotel España . It is a true masterpiece of Catalan art nouveau, modernisme. Staying here is like stepping into the pages of Eduardo Mendoza's novel The City of Marvels: the sgraffito work in the dining room is by the painter Ramon Casas and the monumental alabaster fireplace is by the sculptor Eusebi Arnau. And although the 2010 refurbishments retain the original 19th-century spirit of the building, its comfort is totally 21st century. Hotel Miramar Barcelona (Landmark Hotel). The sea at your feet. The Palau Miramar was built for the 1929 International Exhibition in the early 20th-century style known as noucentisme. Its architect, Ramon Raventós, sought to capture the pure Mediterranean essence of its location. The building was home to the studios of Spanish television from 1959 until the 1980s. In 2006, the famous architect Óscar Tusquets accepted the challenge of bringing back the style and elegance of the building through a modern prism and it reopened as the Hotel Miramar . If you stay here, you're bound to say he's more than fulfilled the brief. We know it's hard to choose, but which one are you going to pick?

You can visit Christmas markets, nativity scenes, charming shops and so much more beneath the magical lights that glitter in the streets. DAY 1: DISCOVERING THE EIXAMPLE 2pm If you arrive in the city at lunchtime, there's nowhere better to stop off than the Eixample district, where you'll get a glimpse of the Christmas spirit that imbues the city, with decorated shops, streets bedecked with glittering lights and the unmistakeable magic of the festive season. Housed in an art nouveau, or modernista , building, Windsor serves Catalan cuisine with a contemporary twist and is a great place for lunch. Another option is L'Olivé , with its Mediterranean dishes and extensive wine list. 4pm If you want to get into the Christmas spirit that's all around the city, visit the Sagrada Família Christmas market where you'll find skilled artisans selling decorative items and one-off pieces. 6pm It's time for a snack. There's nothing more Christmassy than a nice cup of thick hot chocolate with churro fritters or sponge fingers, known as melindros, to boost your energy levels and carry on shopping. The Eixample is full of places where you can enjoy a wonderful snack. Pastisseries Mauri and Boldú , which has several outlets in the area, and Escribà , with its fairytale cakes, are great options if you want to take a sweet break. 6.30pm If you're in the mood for shopping, the Eixample is the perfect place. Its streets and avenues are packed with shops to suit all tastes. You can lose yourself on Rambla de Catalunya, Carrer València and Passeig de Gràcia and be enticed by the range of goods on offer. You'll find your own distinctive Christmas style at Antonio Miró . If you're looking for original, comfortable shoes, make sure you grab a pair from Camper . The city is also the perfect place to find unique, signature jewellery that defies classification. Some of the leading jewellers include Bagués-Masriera , RABAT , and the iconic Tous and Capdevila Joiers . If you're looking for quality designer bags, you'll find one to suit your taste at Lupo . And perfume connoisseurs will find every imaginable fragrance at Regia . Christmas is also about culture, so there could be no better way to round off a day's shopping than surrounding yourself with books. You'll find a great selection in different languages, as well as in Catalan and Spanish, at Ona Llibres . 9pm To end the day with a great dinner featuring tapas and dishes made with fresh market produce, Mordisco will cater to your gastronomic needs. If you have a sweet tooth, make sure you try the cheesecake which is to die for! DAY 2: THE OLD TOWN, CIUTAT VELLA, MAGICAL AND VIBRANT 10am You can't visit Barcelona at Christmas without stopping off in Plaça de Sant Jaume to see the iconic nativity scene. But it isn't the only one in the city. This year we will be celebrating the 19th Catalan Nativity Scene Biennale at the royal chapel of Santa Àgata , which brings together a wonderful array of dioramas made by nativity scene craftsmen and women from all over Catalonia, as well as international associations. As you're in the area, the cathedral cloister and the Museu Frederic Marès also have their own nativity scenes that take us back to different eras every year. To make your morning complete, the Christmas market, the Fira de Santa Llúcia , in front of the cathedral, is a wonderful display of magic and good vibes, with stalls selling trees, the curious pooping figure, the caganer, and all kinds of Christmas decorations. You're bound to find that special item to take home with you! 2pm After a busy morning exploring the Gothic Quarter, why not linger and have an alfresco lunch by the sea? If you have time, you can even head to the beach and have a coffee on the sand. There are so many top-quality restaurants to choose from. The 7 Portes is a classic. Founded almost 200 years ago, it is renowned for its delicious rice dishes. If a stylish terrace serving seafood dishes with views of the port is your thing, 1881 per Sagardi at the Museu d'Història de Catalunya is the perfect place to dine on sunny winter days. If you want to try some of the finest rice and seafood dishes, make a note of Can Solé . 4pm We're still in the old town, Ciutat Vella, where there is no end of things to explore among its cobbled streets with their shimmering Christmas lights. Why not spend the afternoon visiting some of its most iconic shops? Turrón nougats are the number one festive sweet treat and you'll find one to suit your taste at La Campana or Vicens . If you're looking for books or design objects, you'll find them at the Llibreria La Central . For urban, sophisticated clothes from a variety of labels, make sure you visit Ozz Barcelona . At Calpa you'll find all kinds of bags and backpacks and at Empremtes de Catalunya you can browse a wide variety of handcrafted items and see the city's creative side for yourself. La Manual Alpargatera sells the most comfortable and chic handmade footwear and, if you're still wanting more retail therapy, you can end the day at El Corte Inglés , the big department store where you'll find everything you could possibly want. If you're looking for typical Christmas items to decorate your home, Käthe Wohlfahrt has everything you need: Christmas figures, details for the tree or table, decorations, souvenirs and much more. Caganer.com has several shops in the neighbourhood and specialises in the curious pooping figures, the caganer , who you'll find in many different guises, from the Simpsons to Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street. 9pm It's dinner time, so why not wander over to the Born beneath the Christmas lights and soak up the magical, festive atmosphere you'll always find in this neighbourhood at this special time of the year. There are lots of restaurants where you can enjoy a delicious dinner among designer boutiques and trendy bars. Sagardi BCN Gòtic is the perfect eatery for carnivores, while El Passadís del Pep is the go-to place for a seafood platter. The finest chargrilled meats and fish await you at Calabrasa . DAY 3: CONCERTS, FAMILY AND CULTURE 10am We start the day enjoying the wonderful atmosphere in Plaça Catalunya and Plaça Universitat, which host the Christmas festival, the Festival de Nadal , every year. Check out our what's on listings and plan ahead for your short break in the city. There are all kinds of activities to suit all tastes, with mornings dedicated to the kids and evenings of music and entertainment for all. If you want to explore more Christmas markets and get even more out of your trip, take a stroll along La Rambla, among the flower stalls and shops, until you come to the Christmas fair in the old harbour, the Fira de Nadal del Port Vell , which has a great choice of handcrafted items and accessories. 2pm If you're travelling with kids, one of the restaurants in the Poble Espanyol is a great choice. It's packed with all kinds of Christmassy activities for the little ones. If that's not the case, a trip to one of the large retail districts is a great idea. You can choose from Major de Sarrià , Gran de Sant Andreu , Via Júlia or Carrer de Sants , where, in addition to the shops, you'll find all kinds of restaurants where you can enjoy the typical neighbourhood atmosphere and home cooking featuring dishes made with produce fresh from the market. You're bound to have time left to browse the shops, as they open for longer over the festive season, including Sundays and public holidays. They will be closed on 25th and 26th December as well as on 1st and 6th January. 4pm If you still have a little time to spare after lunch, make sure you check out the programme of Christmas concerts to bring your two days in the city to a perfect and melodic end. Pedralbes Monastery , the Palau de la Música Catalana , L'Auditori and churches, like Santa Maria del Pi , bring you a season of thrilling Christmas concerts. Check out what's on. We're sure you'll go back to your daily routine with your energy levels replenished and filled with the indescribable magic of Christmas in Barcelona.

Jews represented 10% of the overall population of Barcelona. Barcelona's geographical location and thriving economy, which resulted from it opening up to international trade, made the city's Jewish Quarter, El Call, a meeting point and place of refuge for Jews everywhere. As you walk through the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter you will be transported back to these stories and legacies. With the intention of promoting the Sephardic legacy of the city and to attract the Jewish market, Turisme de Barcelona launched "" Shalom Barcelona "" marketplace that showcases the specialised contents and products the city has to offer Jewish visitors with the aim of targeting a very important and specific market with its own unique culture and customs. The "" Shalom Barcelona "" website is a platform that promotes Barcelona as a destination and highlights the importance of Jewish heritage in the city's history. The platform is in English and Hebrew and features specific aspects of our offer, such as accommodation near Barcelona's synagogues, a section on food featuring kosher restaurants, official guides specialising in Sephardic culture and another with information for tourism sector professionals.

It was the beginning of a unique gastronomic movement led by a few visionary chefs, such as Ferran Adrià , Santi Santamaria , Joan Roca, and Carme Ruscalleda , who catapulted our cuisine to the top of the world. Two decades later, that haute cuisine revolution has spread and multiplied all over the world. That legacy continues today thanks to committed and courageous chefs with personal, unique, and solid restaurant projects in the city,  who carry on the DNA of our cuisine . Read more Catalan cuisine offers genius and constant innovation, respect for tradition with an eye to the future, and local, seasonal produce. There are many ways to enjoy Barcelona and one of them is through the gastronomic revolution that the city is experiencing, but if you need more reasons to try it, keep reading! Taste the best restaurants renowned all over the world Barcelona has 29 restaurants with 42 Michelin stars and 15 restaurants holding the Bib Gourmand award, in addition to 54 establishments that have obtained suns from the Repsol Guide . This means that, if you are a fan of signature cuisine, you cannot miss Barcelona's unbeatable gastronomic offer! From the three Michelin stars of Martín Berasategui's Lasarte, Jordi Cruz's Àbac and the cuisine of Disfrutar , headed by Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch, and Mateu Casañas and recognized as one of the 50 best restaurants in the world ; the fusion cuisine of Dos Palillos , by Albert Raurich and Tamae Imachi, and Koy Shunka, by Hideki Matsuhisa and Caelis (Romain Fornell), among many others, Barcelona has hundreds of restaurants waiting to surprise you and to prove why Catalan cuisine is one of the most renowned in the world . Discover unique restaurants with a lot of history Can you imagine eating at a restaurant that opened its doors during the Industrial Revolution? Barcelona is a city where history is everywhere, even when it comes to gastronomy. To experience that, you simply need to go to Can Culleretes, one of the oldest restaurants in the city , located in the Gothic Quarter, which opened its doors in 1789. But this is not the only establishment with a long history! In Ciutat Vella, you will find several places that were born in the 19th century and that are still in great shape: Bar Marsella – where they still serve their famous absinthe liquor –, Los Caracoles, 7 Portes , where you can try a Parellada rice dish and have pajamas for dessert, Casa Almirante and 4 Gats, among others. Discover the authentic Catalan cuisine Did you know that the oldest recipe book on Catalan cuisine , El Llibre de Sent Soví , dates back to the 14th century? Much has changed since then, of course, but the essence of Catalan gastronomy has remained the same and there is no better place to discover it than Barcelona, where you can taste the main recipes of Catalan cuisine. At Gaig Barcelona, headed by Carles Gaig, some of the best cannelloni in the city await you. At Can Ramonet , in Barceloneta, you can discover why the Bomba de la Barceloneta (a big croquette made with potato and stuffed with meat with a spicy touch) is called so.  At the restaurant La Habana, in Raval, you can't miss the fricandó , one of the most emblematic stews of Catalan cuisine, which has been recognized as the Catalan people's favorite dish in 2021 . Enter and savor the 39 markets in Barcelona with fresh produce If you are interested in learning where the ingredients of the dishes that you can find in Barcelona's restaurants come from, we have good news for you. All you have to do is visit one of the 39 fresh produce markets spread throughout the city's districts. The best known and most spectacular markets are La Boqueria –which was named the best market in the world in 2017 – and Santa Caterina , in Ciutat Vella; but every neighborhood in Barcelona has its own market: Gracia, Carmel, Sants, Hostafrancs... We invite you to visit them and discover what the locals actually eat, how they buy, and what is the origin of the fresh produce that is sold there. In addition, if you are hungry, you can also have a delicious meal with the finest fresh products. Discover restaurants that are works of art Eating is a multisensory experience, which means that restaurateurs should surprise you from the moment you walk through the door. The diversity of architectural styles that you can see in the streets of Barcelona is also reflected in its restaurants. You can delve into the modernist spaces of 4 Gats, Cafè 1907, and Fonda España, or in the 60s atmosphere or the gauche divine of Flash-Flash (specialized in all kinds of frittatas). What about the modern architecture of Àbac, Disfrutar, and many other restaurants that use design, innovation, and creativity to surprise their visitors? Many of these restaurants are committed to Mediterranean and local cuisine and are the protagonists of the city's gastronomic revolution . Enjoy a vermouth on one of Barcelona's terraces Walking around Barcelona on a Sunday afternoon leads to some very interesting surprises. You will certainly find that the terraces of bars and restaurants are buzzing with activity, with groups of friends and families gathered for an appetizer and a vermouth. In fact, the vermouth tradition, which is deeply rooted throughout the country, implies a whole ritual: you need chips or patatas bravas with spicy sauce, olives, and marinated anchovies,  again with a special sauce, all with a nice glass of red vermouth. Many of the best red vermouths come from Reus, near Tarragona, and there is no better way to discover them than by sitting on a terrace and enjoying a traditional glass of vermouth , or by visiting the traditional wineries of Barcelona , where, in addition to trying vermouth, you can buy it. Learn about gastronomic traditions The gastronomic heritage of Catalonia dates back to medieval times and is still based on the value of the local produce, which reflects the immense richness of the Catalan landscape: the sea, the mountains, the fields, the forests... This tradition gave birth to recipes that are very popular today. The people of Barcelona love good food and traditionally good times gathered around a table. In fact, traditional holidays and festivals are usually associated with some kind of food. Read more If you visit Barcelona around January 6, when the Three Wise Men come to the city to deliver presents for the children, you will find tortells (king cakes) in the windows of all the bakeries: from the most classic cakes, with marzipan and candied fruit, to modern versions with cream and truffle. For Sant Jordi, the bakeries make a special bread , with cheese and sobrassada (a spicy pork sausage) that simulates the Catalan flag, and for Sant Joan, they bake a special cake with cream or candied fruit. Still hungry for more? Well, if you come to Barcelona at the end of October, you will discover tiny surprises called panellets , small cakes made with almond flour and topped with pine nuts and many other delicious combinations! On Fat Thursday, during Carnival, the charcuteries hang egg sausages, and the pastry shops offer plenty of coques de llardons . If you prefer to come for Sant Josep, on March 19, you will taste a delicious crema catalana (Catalan cream) and at Easter, you can eat bunyols de quaresma , sweet fritters with a touch of aniseed covered with sugar, or buy a mona de Pascua , a traditional cake decorated with chocolate eggs that godparents give to their godchildren on Easter Monday. At Christmas , one of the most magical times of the year in Barcelona, meals are celebrated with a tasty escudella soup and meat cannelloni.  And don't forget the sweets: nougats (made with almonds, honey, egg white, and sugar) of all the flavors you can imagine and rolled wafers (made of flour, water, and sugar with a touch of lemon). Come see how fish gets from the boat to the fish market. In such a modern and cosmopolitan city like Barcelona, you can still find traditional activities related to food. Barcelona has one of the most important ports in Southern Europe with lots of freight traffic, but it also has a fishing pier (in Barceloneta, the fishing neighborhood) where every day the boats of the Fishermen's Association go fishing and then extremely fresh fish is auctioned at the fish market, so that the restaurants of the city, some in the very same fishing neighborhood, can prepare succulent seafood dishes. Share Barcelona's commitment to sustainability The core idea that the only possible future is a sustainable future has long permeated Barcelona's food model. In fact, the city launched the first wholesale market of fresh organic food in Europe, called Biomarket , in 2021, when Barcelona was the World Capital of Sustainable Food . This is part of the food strategy based on proximity produce and zero kilometer products. You can also see all this in the food markets, where the stalls that focus on local production are identified with Comerç Verd (green trade) labels, as well as in restaurants that work with local suppliers. Experience gastronomic events all year round Are you one of those people who, when traveling, are not satisfied with just touring the city, but also want to experience the festivals and fairs? In Barcelona, the gastronomic agenda is full of interesting events that gather thousands of visitors around food and cuisine every year! From Tast a la Rambla in early June, which brings together restaurants and producers at the end of Barcelona's most famous promenade, to the Market of Markets in fall, when the city's markets take to the streets with stalls and tastings; events dedicated to street food, such as Born Street Food; Fira Àpat , dedicated to local Catalan food, in October; and the Earth Market , organized on Saturdays by Slow Food Barcelona . Barcelona is the ideal place for foodies ! And if you are lucky enough to visit Barcelona in summer, you can enjoy outdoor meals at the various festivals in Barcelona's neighborhoods, such as Sants and Gracia, and also during the city's main festival, ‘la Mercè’, celebrated on September 24.

Watch Video About this route Introduction Lisbon is made of light, the river, hills and stories. And many of these stories live behind old shop counters, among glass jars, centuries-old display cabinets and wood polished by time. On this tour we follow the living traces of a city that reinvents itself without forgetting who it is. Shops with History resist time, haste, and fads, and preserve memories and traditions that are part of Lisbon's identity. They are hat shops, bookshops, glove shops, pastry shops, restaurants, hardware stores, grocery stores, jewellers, tobacconists and canneries, where ancient crafts continue to be practised with mastery and knowledge is passed down from generation to generation like a well-kept secret. Unique spaces, where the past is offered up in every good morning, each gesture and every detail. Each shop, with its unique personality, tells us a little about the soul of Lisbon. From leisure facilities to everyday services, from iconic restaurants to almost secret spots, this is a trip around a city that pulsates with tradition. Let's follow this emotional map where each point is a story - and each story, a place where the customer is still king. The History of Shops in Lisbon Lisbon has always been a city of commerce. Since medieval times, fairs and markets were the main centres of trade, where spices, fabrics, ceramics and other precious goods from distant lands were traded. With the arrival of the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, Lisbon became one of the largest trading ports in the world, attracting European, African and Asian merchants. Spices from India, sugar from the colonies and gold from Brazil contributed greatly to a vibrant economy that shaped the city. It was during the 18th century, after the 1755 earthquake, that Lisbon underwent a significant urban reconstruction. Streets were organised by trades, creating specific areas for different types of commerce. For example, Rua dos Fanqueiros was dedicated to fabric sellers, while Rua do Ouro was home to jewellers and goldsmiths. This model influenced the emergence of specialised shops, many of which still stand today as living testimonies to that period. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, traditional shops became part of everyday life for the people of Lisbon. More than just commercial establishments, they served as social and cultural meeting places. Many of them still use production methods that date back to their origins. Luvaria Ulysses, founded in 1925, is a perfect example of this spirit. Located in Rua do Carmo, the shop has only enough space for one customer at a time, but offers custom-made gloves with techniques that have been passed down through the generations. Chapelaria Azevedo Rua, open since 1886, continues to supply elegant hats that have marked eras, as a symbol of style and tradition. Another icon is the Caza das Vellas Loreto, founded in 1789, which produces handmade candles used in religious ceremonies and historical events. These handmade candles not only illuminate physical spaces, but also the collective memory of Lisbon. Standing out among the curiosities and fascinating stories of historic shops is the Hospital das Bonecas (Doll Hospital), founded in 1830. This small establishment in downtown Lisbon specialises in repairing antique dolls and toys. Each restored item tells stories of childhood and affection, making it a true ""hospital"" of memories. Livraria Bertrand, recognised by the Guinness World Records as the oldest bookshop in the world still in operation, opened its doors in 1732. Frequented by writers such as Eça de Queirós, Alexandre Herculano and other intellectuals, it is still a haven for literature lovers. Conserveira de Lisboa, inaugurated in 1930, transformed canned fish into genuine works of art. Their products, packed in vintage boxes, are highly sought after by both locals and tourists. A Brasileira, which opened in 1905, was a meeting place for intellectuals and artists, including Fernando Pessoa. Today, its terrace in the Chiado is one of the most photographed places in Lisbon. In a world dominated by globalisation and large retail chains, Lisbon's historic shops stand as bastions of authenticity. They represent a link between the past and present, preserving traditions that are part of the city's cultural identity. Entering one of these shops is like travelling back in time, discovering stories hidden behind wooden counters and centuries-old display cabinets. Treasures of Lisbon: Traditional Products of Shops with History Foodstuffs Canned sardines Sardines are a symbol of Portuguese culture and especially of Lisbon, where they are celebrated in June during the Festas de Santo António, the city's popular patron saint. Conserveira de Lisboa, founded in 1930, has elevated canned fish to an art form, with packaging that has become iconic. Besides sardines, the shop offers mackerel, tuna, roe of various species, and other fish, all prepared with traditional methods. Where : Conserveira de Lisboa Dried cod Cod is known as the ""faithful friend"" and is present in countless traditional dishes. In Lisbon, it is essential for recipes such as bacalhau à Brás, à la Gomes de Sá (northern codfish recipe) or codfish patties. Manteigaria Silva is famous for offering high-quality cod, often hung on display, creating a unique atmosphere around this product. Where : Manteigaria Silva Wine from Carcavelos This fortified wine with centuries of tradition, produced in the Lisbon region, specifically in Carcavelos, is a true nectar of Portuguese oenology. With notes of dried fruit, caramel and spices, it is ideal as an aperitif, for accompanying cheese or more elaborate desserts. Where : Garrafeira Nacional Wine from Colares Produced in the stunning region of Sintra, wines from Colares stand out due to their uniqueness, thanks to the vineyards planted in sandy soils near the Atlantic. With delicate aromas and a unique mineral character, they are perfect for accompanying fish or seafood dishes. Where : Garrafeira Nacional Azeitão Cheese This cheese, produced in the Azeitão region, stands out for its creamy texture and intense flavour. It is ideal to be enjoyed on its own or accompanied by a good wine and traditional bread. Where : Manteigaria Silva Moscatel from Setúbal This sweet wine, produced in the Lisbon region, specifically in Setúbal, is very popular as an aperitif or digestif. With notes of honey and citrus, it is perfect to accompany desserts or simply to enjoy in a historic café such as Martinho da Arcada. Where : Garrafeira Nacional Ginja liqueur (or Ginjinha) This cherry liqueur, made from a type of cherry, is one of Lisbon's classics. Served in small glasses, with or without the fruit, it is a ritual for anyone visiting the city. A Ginjinha, in Largo de São Domingos, is the most famous place to try this drink. Where : A Ginjinha Bolo-Rei Introduced in Portugal in the 19th century, Bolo-Rei is a Christmas classic – a cake in the shape of a crown, with light and tasty dough, filled with dried and candied fruits. Confeitaria Nacional, founded in 1829, was one of the first to produce this cake in Lisbon, following a French recipe adapted to Portuguese tastes. Where : Confeitaria National Pastel de Belém The Pastel de Belém (custard tart) is a puff pastry dessert filled with egg, milk and sugar cream. It is one of Lisbon's most famous specialities and a true icon of the city. They originated from the Jerónimos Monastery in Belém, where monks began making this dessert to avoid wasting egg yolks. Where : Confeitaria de Belém Candied Almonds These sugar-coated almonds are a traditional sweet, especially popular at Easter. Where : Casa Macário Clothing and Accessories Leather gloves In Luvaria Ulisses, a small shop in Rua do Carmo that is so narrow that only one customer can enter at a time, gloves are made to measure, preserving handicraft techniques that go back to the start of the 20th century. Where : Luvaria Ulisses Hats In Lisbon, hats paraded through the town squares and avenues, becoming part of the urban landscape and etiquette that defined the city's customs. Models as the fedora or beret were indispensable, each reflecting the style and personality of their wearer. Where : Chapelaria Azevedo Rua Handmade shoes The Sapataria do Carmo (Carmo shoe shop) in the Chiado has sold handmade shoes, known for their durability and timeless style, since 1904. Many Lisbon residents still prefer handmade shoes, made one at a time, to industrialised options. Where : Sapataria do Carmo Gold and silver jewellery In the city's historic jewellery shops you can find unique pieces, often inspired by traditional Portuguese designs, such as maritime motifs. Where :  Joalharia Ferreira Marques e Leitão e Irmão Cultural and Decorative Products Books by Portuguese authors Books by Portuguese authors are a reflection of the soul and history of the country, immortalising its culture in words. Works such as those by Fernando Pessoa, whose connection with Lisbon is as deep as it is poetic, and José Saramago, who explored the roots and contradictions of Portuguese identity (his ashes are in front of the Casa dos Bicos in Campo das Cebolas, where the Foundation of the same name operates) – continue to inspire generations of readers. In Livraria Bertrand, in the Chiado area, recognised as the oldest in the world still in operation, these stories find a home in a space that celebrates the city's literary tradition and cultural richness. Where : Livraria Bertrand Handmade candles Founded in 1789, Caza das Vellas Loreto produces candles used in religious ceremonies and historical events, and currently offers a wide variety of aromas to perfume homes and other environments. Each candle is handmade, keeping a centuries-old tradition alive. Where : Caza das Vellas Loreto Handcrafted knives Cutelaria Polycarpo’s knives are known for their precision and durability. Many of them feature engraved designs that reflect Portuguese landscapes or cultural symbols. Where : Cutelaria Polycarpo Decorative hardware At Ferragens Guedes, a centuries-old shop, you can find door handles and locks that reflect the architectural style of Lisbon, especially the Pombaline buildings. Where : Ferragens Guedes Health and Wellness Products Medicinal herbs and natural teas In Ervanária Rosil, natural remedies for ailments of the body and mind have been available for decades. Since 1950, the tradition of blending individual plants or special compositions has been kept alive, with teas that promise almost miraculous effects. The famous ""tea no. 6"", known as the ""miracle tea"", is one of the most sought after. Where : Ervanária Rosil Blue and white soap This soap is a classic, used for both household cleaning and personal care. Its simple and effective formula has been passed down for generations and remains a must-have in Lisbon households. Where : Drogaria Oriental Other Unique Products Cigars and pipes For decades cigars and pipes were symbols of style and sophistication, associated with moments of relaxation and socialising. In Lisbon, these products became part of urban culture, accompanying conversations in cafés, formal meetings and even celebratory rituals. Tabacaria Mónaco, in Rossio, is an iconic venue that preserves this tradition, offering carefully selected cigars and elegant pipes in an environment steeped in history and art. Where : Tabacaria Mónaco Barbershop items Barbershop items, such as razors and shaving brushes, have always been symbols of personal care and masculine elegance. In Lisbon, places like Barbearia Oliveira keep this tradition alive, offering not only products but also a service that evoke memories of a time when the ritual of shaving was a gesture of style and identity.

An experience that crosses all the senses and emotions - the sound, the visual, the virtual, the immersive and the unexpected. From €17 Details Ah Amália – Living Experience won the World Travel Awards in the category of Europe's New Leading Tourist Attraction. This prestigious award recognises Ah Amália – Living Experience as an innovative cultural experience that celebrates Fado and, above all, the legacy of Amália , whose life and work continue to inspire artists and visitors alike. This recognition also highlights Lisbon's strong performance in the ‘Tourism Oscars’, with the city also being awarded Europe's Leading City Break Destination 2025 . The first immersive biographical story dedicated to a national personality. A journey of emotions hand in hand with one of the most inspiring women of all time.

One that crosses all the senses and emotions - the sound, the visual, the virtual, the immersive and the unexpected.

In the eight rooms of this exhibition, we combine different thematic environments, where you can get to know Amália in her various dimensions - artistic, social, personal and international. What you'll find Virtual Reality Crossing a high-impact scenic installation with a virtual reality experience, the physical and digital dimensions come together to provide a unique experience in which you can live the Amália of yesterday, today and forever. 360º Room In this room we get to know Amália through an immersive 360º experience, using multimedia and videomapping, allowing the viewer to feel part of this ""Strange Way of Life"". Hologram With a full-scale hologram and scenography that replicates the Olympia stage in Paris, the public will have the unique opportunity to witness a performance by the fado singer. Ah, Amália - Living Experience brings together SP Entertainment and the Amália Rodrigues Foundation for the voice of a culture.  This exhibition would not be possible without the inexhaustible support of the Amália Rodrigues Foundation, whose mission is to promote and publicise Amália's contribution to the affirmation of national identity.

Lisbon,https://www.visitlisboa.com/en/lisbon-stories/2-saramago-route,1,"Saramago Route | Visit Lisboa Turismo de Lisboa Logo Search Profile EN PT ES FR DE IT Turismo de Lisboa Logo Search Search My Profile EN PT ES FR DE IT Lisbon Story Saramago Route In 1998, he was awarded Nobel Prize in Literature. Watch Video About this route Biography José Saramago José Saramago was born on 16th November 1922 in Azinhaga, a village in the province of Ribatejo that was as humble as his own family. Although he grew up in a house without books, he soon fell in love with them. He first came into contact with literature at school, but later, when he had to leave to start work as a toolmaker, the thrall in which books held him ensured he was a regular visitor to his local library. Intellectually curious, the young Saramago became an autodidact and a man committed to the causes of his time. An opponent of Salazar and his dictatorship, he joined the Communist Party in 1969. He was also a staunch critic of the Catholic Church, the target of choice of some of the books he would later write, such as “Baltasar and Blimunda” (1982), “The Gospel According to Jesus Christ” (1991) and “Cain” (2009). Until devoting himself fully to his literary career, which he did from 1976 onwards, he had various professions. He was a draughtsman, health and social worker, translator, editor and journalist. His first novel, “Land of Sin”, dates from 1947. It took him another 19 years to publish his second book, a volume of poetry called “Possible Poems”. In the years that followed, his literary output was regular and wide-ranging, encompassing fields as varied as poetry, novels, short stories and plays. As a novelist, he achieved recognition when he won the “Cidade de Lisboa” award for “Raised from the Ground”, which became an international bestseller. For the novel “Baltasar and Blimunda” (1982), considered his most iconic work, he received the “Pen Clube Português” award. “The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis” (1984) won the “Prémio da Crítica”, “Prémio Dom Diniz”, the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the “Pen Clube Português” award again. A year later, he was made a Commander of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (in 1998 he was promoted to the rank of a Grand Collar of the same Order, an honour generally reserved only for heads of state). In 1995, he was awarded the highest accolade in Portuguese literature, the “Prémio Camões”, and three years later won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Translated into 42 languages, his work began to gain recognition from the film industry in 2008 when his novel “Blindness” (1995), directed by Fernando Meirelles, was adapted for the big screen. This was followed in 2010 by the film adaptation of a short story from the book “The Lives of Things” which was made into the film “Embargo” by the Portuguese director António Ferreira. After marrying his second wife, the Spanish journalist Pilar del Rio, he settled in Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, in 1993. Always aware of the world around him, his literary achievements never prevented him from devoting his energies to the causes which interested him. In 2007, he set up the Fundação José Saramago to defend and disseminate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and environmental problems, but he did not live long enough to witness its inauguration in 2012 at the Casa dos Bicos in Lisbon. He died in Spain on 18th June 2010, but the foundation he gave his name to continues to promote the cultural and social project presided over by his wife, Pilar del Rio. Synopsis of Baltasar And Blimunda Published in 1982, “Baltasar and Blimunda” is José Saramago’s most iconic novel. Translated into more than 20 languages, in over 50 editions, it examines a recurring theme in the writer’s work: the clash between rich and poor, the exploiter and the exploited. The story takes place in the 18th century during the reign of João V, the king responsible for building the Monastery of Mafra, an enormous project paid for out of the gold imported from Brazil, which at the time was a Portuguese colony. The contrast between the king’s megalomania and the misery of the common people who built the monastery runs through the whole novel and is scathingly evoked by the writer. And, inevitably, in the midst of all this, an enchanting love story unfolds. Characters from de novel ""Baltasar e Blimunda"" Blimunda de Jesus or Blimunda Seven-Moons A young peasant woman with the ability to read people’s minds and perceive their desires. The narrator states that the heroine of “Baltasar and Blimunda” came by her extraordinary powers while in her mother’s belly, where she waited with her eyes wide open. She meets Baltasar at an auto-de-fé and falls head-over-heels in love. Baltasar Mateus or Baltasar Seven-Suns Left to fend for himself by the army during the War of the Spanish Succession after he lost his left hand, he meets Blimunda when he arrives in Lisbon and immediately falls in love. A simple, loyal and loving man, he accepts what life brings with the resignation of the humble. He dies at the stake at an auto-de-fé. King João V Presented as a caricature figure, especially when describing his least ingratiating qualities, he represents absolute power, for which the ends justify the means. It is under his orders that the megalomaniacal project to build the Monastery of Mafra is started, under the pretext of a vow made to the clergy to guarantee the succession to the throne. Maria-Ana of Austria A woman of her age, her marriage to João V is one of convenience and the only means of self-affirmation in their loveless union is through motherhood. She is therefore obsessed with her fertility and when she becomes pregnant, after long and anxious novenas, she believes God is responsible. She has sinful thoughts about her brother-in-law which make her feel guilty and cause her to redouble her prayers. Sebastiana Maria de Jesus The daughter of New Christians, she is persecuted and convicted by the Inquisition. Accused of blasphemy and heresy, she appears before an auto-de-fé in Rossio where she is whipped and later deported to Angola. She bids her daughter Blimunda farewell telepathically so as not to shame her in public. It is through her that Blimunda meets Baltasar. Padre Bartolomeu de Gusmão Gifted with a scientific mind, he is detached from the religious fanaticism of his age. He nurtures the dream of building a flying machine, from which comes his nickname the “Flying Man”. At the start, he enjoys royal protection for his daring project, but is later left dependent on the help of his loyal friends Baltasar and Blimunda. He manages to fly up to the heavens, but is eventually persecuted by the Inquisition, accused of witchcraft. He flees to Spain where he eventually dies. Unlike the other characters in the book, Bartolomeu de Gusmão actually existed in real life. Domenico Scarlatti Held the position of chapel master and teacher to the Royal Household from 1720 to 1729. Though hired by the king, he is enough of a free spirit to secretly aid the flying passarola project and on one occasion even manages to cure Blimunda through his music, becoming her friend. Like Bartolomeu de Gusmão, this character, though fictionalised in “Baltasar and Blimunda”, existed in real life. The Common People The weakest link, consisting of the poor exposed to the harshest trials and tribulations. Sometimes it is the source of surprising figures, brave and resilient souls who are driven by the purest sentiments of genuine love and friendship. This is the case with Blimunda and Baltasar, examples of the noblest spirit human nature has to offer. The Clergy José Saramago is implacable in his attitude towards the Catholic Church, a target he takes aim at in several of his books. In “Baltasar and Blimunda”, whose action takes place at the height of the Inquisition, the trail of immorality left by the powerful is clearly visible. The picture painted of the clergy is one of truly overwhelming cruelty and hypocrisy and the concentration of power. Lisbon Story Pessoa Route",1361

Watch Video About this route Introduction Beach and Countryside (Without Leaving the City) Lisbon does not just stand out for its unique and unmistakeable light. Surrounded by both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, it is one of the world’s most complete cities. Mafra , or to be more precise Tapada Nacional de Mafra (Mafra National Park) (TNM), offers an unexpected range of habitats, from woods to pasture land, bushland to rivers, that sustain a large diversity of animal species. The Serra de Sintra , whose coastline is of great ecological and cultural interest, is remarkably diverse. From walking trails and roads to palaces and castles full of history, not to mention a huge range of marine activities, this is a genuine oasis for those who truly enjoy Mother Nature. Sintra and its surrounding area is a World Heritage Site. Monserrate Palace and Park , one of the richest botanical gardens in Portugal and one of the most beautiful examples of Romantic-era landscaping, deserve visitors’ full appreciation. A little further along the coast is Cascais with its dune system and one of the most iconic beaches for those who enjoy sailing (or just love wild beaches): Guincho . Much further south, the pursuit of nature continues. Between the blue of the sea and the green of the hills, the Parque Natural da Serra da Arrábida ( Serra da Arrábida Nature Park) is an excellent place to test your physical limits. Like a green wall rising vertically beside the Atlantic, the Serra da Arrábida conceals small bays of white sand and, although at the edge of the ocean, the sea here has almost no waves. Far from the hills and closer to the sea stands Portinho da Arrábida . This is a good diving spot, with its unique fauna and flora. For those who have a thing for acquiring new knowledge, the Oceanographic Museum , housed in the Fort of Santa Maria da Arrábida, promises to provide the answers to lots of questions linked to the issues of the sea and the hills. Enjoyment of some of the most beautiful beaches in the country (and Europe) continues with the Galápos , Galapinhos and the hidden Praia dos Coelhos and Praia da Figueirinha, one of the most popular. It is also possible just to contemplate the beauty of nature and nothing more from various viewing points. The Miradouro das Antenas, Miradouro da Santa ou Arremula and Miradouro dos Conventos all promise stunning vistas. In front of the eastern end of Lisbon stands the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Tejo (Tagus Estuary Nature Reserve) , better known as the “Mar da Palha” (Straw Sea). These are the largest wetlands in the country and among the tenth most important in Europe. Their status was awarded to protect the migratory seabirds that nest here. During migrating season, the estuary is home to more than 120,000 birds. The Reserve extends to Vila Franca de Xira, covering an area of meadowland where bulls and horses are reared. Other traditional activities, today in decline, have left remains of their presence, such as the Salinas do Samouco (Samouco Salt Pans) and the Moinhos de Marés no Seixal (Seixal Tide Mills), currently being used as eco-museums. South of the bridge across the Tagus, the main highlight is the Protected Landscape of the Fossil Cliffs of Costa da Caparica (PPAFCC), which extends along the coastline from the town of Costa da Caparica to Lagoa de Albufeira, within the boundaries of the municipalities of Almada and Sesimbra. Further south, the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado (Sado Estuary Nature Reserve) suggests other attractions, such as dolphins and the over 250 species that are seen in this area. The Moinho de Maré da Mourisca (Mourisca Tide Mill) is one of the best places to do it. Lisbon is a place whose interest goes beyond what a city has to offer. Beach or countryside, high mountains or plains, when the theme is the vast range of tourist attractions, Lisbon’s sky (and its outskirts) really is the limit. Terrestrial Trail Real adventurers will love this. There is a lot of new ground to break when it comes to visiting the land. And when we say the land, we also mean mountains, hills, bush and plain. And we also mean animals that still roam free and the plants that survive the planet’s rampant modernisation. Fortunately, as Spanish people say, “ que las hay, las hay”. Mafra , or to be more precise Tapada Nacional de Mafra (Mafra National Park) (TNM), offers an unexpected range of habitats, from woods to pasture land, bushland to rivers, that sustain a large diversity of animal species. To this specific diversity can be added the high conservation value of, for example, the Bonelli’s eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus) and the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). Mafra to the Serra de Sintra is just a short trip. These magical and enchanting hills, whose coastline is of great ecological and cultural interest, are remarkably diverse. From walking trails and roads to palaces and castles full of history, the Serra de Sintra is a genuine oasis for those who truly enjoy Mother Nature. Visitors can explore a variety of trees, bushes, flowers and even the nicest creatures. Sintra, and the whole surrounding area, is a World Heritage Site. Monserrate Palace and Park , one of the richest gardens in Portugal and one of the most beautiful examples of Romantic-era landscaping in Portugal, are worth every minute of appreciation. Between the blue of the sea and the green of the hills, the Parque Natural da Serra da Arrábida (Serra da Arrábida Nature Park) is an excellent place to test your physical limits. Orienteering and cycle tours are a good way to get to know this example of pure Mediterranean vegetation. It is possible to choose just the right level of difficulty and there are even night walks available. For the adventurous, the challenges offered by the Serra da Arrábida are many: from the more extreme – with activities including coasteering, canoeing, trekking, 4x4 tours, diving, snorkelling and caving – to the more gentle – including dolphin watching and boat tours. Further on, the Reserva Natural do Tejo (Tagus Nature Reserve), extends to Vila Franca de Xira, covering an area of meadowland where bulls and horses are reared. The Reserve can be visited on foot, by bicycle or by car, following the proposed routes. For anyone looking for a different perspective, you can take a tour on one of the traditional vessels, such as a fragata or varino . Just as beautiful, the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado (Sado Estuary Nature Reserve) suggests other attractions, such as dolphins – which accompany the boat tours – and the over 250 species that can be seen in this area. The Moinho de Maré da Mourisca (Mourisca Tide Mill) is one of the best places to do it Leaving the centre of the city and setting off to discover the beauty of the land is truly good for you. Your heart will thank you, and so will your state of mind. And, after all, it is just around the corner. Maritime Trail One day may not be enough for the sea of programmes (excuse the pun) that the ocean has in store. Sintra is a good place to start your adventure. The Serra de Sintra , whose coastline is of great ecological and cultural interest, is remarkably diverse. Praia Grande , Praia das Maçãs and Azenhas do Mar promise to fill the expectations of those who visit these beaches – and not necessarily for the grandeur of the sea that normally characterises them. A little further along the coast is Cascais with its dune system and one of the most iconic beaches for those who enjoy sailing (or just love wild – and windy – beaches): Guincho . Much further south, pursuit of the ocean continues, along with high levels of expectation. But then again, the Arrábida area is breathtaking. Like a green wall rising vertically beside the Atlantic, the Serra da Arrábida conceals small bays of white sand and, although at the edge of the ocean, the sea here has almost no waves. Far from the hills and closer to the sea stands Portinho da Arrábida . This is a good diving spot, with its unique fauna and flora. For those who have a thing for acquiring new knowledge, the Oceanographic Museum , housed in the Fort of Santa Maria da Arrábida, promises to provide the answers to lots of questions linked to the issues of the sea and the hills. Enjoyment of some of the most beautiful beaches in the country (and Europe, as already acclaimed) continues with the Galápos , Galapinhos and the hidden Praia dos Coelhos and Praia da Figueirinha. In front of the eastern end of Lisbon stands the stunning Reserva Natural do Estuário do Tejo (Tagus Estuary Nature Reserve) , whose vastness has granted it the name the “Mar da Palha” (Straw Sea). These are the largest wetlands in the country and among the tenth most important in Europe. Their status was awarded to protect the migratory seabirds that nest here. During migrating season, the estuary is home to more than 120,000 birds, most notably the pied avocet, accounting for over 20% of Western Europe’s entire population. The beauty continues south of the bridge across the Tagus. The main highlight is the Protected Landscape of the Fossil Cliffs of Costa da Caparica (PPAFCC), which extends along the coastline from the town of Costa da Caparica – where the choice is hard given the diverse range – to Lagoa de Albufeira. Even further south, one comes to the stunning Estuário do Sado (Sado Estuary). This nature reserve has other attractions, such as dolphins, which accompany the boat tours, and the over 250 species that can be seen in this area. The Moinho de Maré da Mourisca (Mourisca Tide Mill) is one of the best places to do it. From the wild waves of Sintra to the paradise that is Arrábida, Lisbon suggests beaches and marine areas that suit the most demanding lovers of water. Diving is believing.

Besides having one of the most important churches in the city, the artworks inside are unique. 25% with Lisboa Card Details The church and convent of São Vicente de Fora are a must when visiting Lisbon. Not just to discover a place erected after the taking of the city in the Christian reconquest, but also to see one of the grandest religious buildings in the capital. Of the original Romanesque church promised by King Afonso Henriques to St Vincent – the patron saint of Lisbon – little remains, except the original site of its construction. The extraordinary Mannerist complex you can visit today was begun in the last years of the 16th century and it was Filipe II of Spain who ordered the reconstruction of a monument known for its simplicity, symmetry and balance. Climb the imposing steps and discover the stone-lined and marble-decorated church, where the chapels of Santíssimo and Nossa Senhora do Pilar stand out for their age and exquisite decoration. The high chapel also has a Baroque altar requested by King João V and the organ from São Vicente, one of the best in Lisbon. It is also recommended that you visit the Sala da Portaria at the entrance to the monastic quarters.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/villa-este,1,"Villa d'Este (Tivoli) - Reviews and how to get there and back Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa d'Este (Tivoli) Villa d’Este is a sumptuous Renaissance dwelling located in the outskirts of Rome. It stands out for its beautiful gardens and charmingly decorated rooms. A former Franciscan monastery expropriated by the governor of Tivoli, the Villa d’Este was built during the sixteenth century in Tivoli as a stately Renaissance-style mansion with enchanting gardens. Nowadays, it is a museum listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. What to see All the rooms in Villa d’Este are beautifully decorated with frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings. However, the most breathtaking part of the villa is the fantastic views of the garden and countryside below. Strolling through the mansion’s lush gardens full of sculptures and over 500 fountains is the best part of the visit. The enclosure’s Hundred Fountains (Cento Fontane in Italian), located between the Fontana di Rometta and the oval fountain, is an architectural masterpiece. The garden also houses a superb waterfall, and the Fountain of the Organ (Fontana dell’Organo) is worthwhile discovering. In 1571, the fountain had a water organ installed in it, which was astonishing to everyone who heard it. A perfect getaway If you want to spend a day discovering Tivoli, Villa d’Este is a definite must. Exploring its gardens while enjoying the coolness of its fountains and the shade of its trees is extremely agreeable, especially in summer. Villa d’Este is located just 19 miles (30 km) from Rome, making it a perfect getaway trip from the bustling city. Visitors can combine this visit with Villa Adriana , which is located very close by. Getting to Villa d’Este There are several ways of getting to Villa d’Este: Guided tour : This is the easiest option. It includes a hotel pick-up, transport there and back, guided tour in English and admissions tickets. The price per person is € 125 and can be booked here: Villa Adriana and Villa d'Este Excursion . Bus : The buses that travel from Rome to Tivoli leave from the bus station Ponte Mammolo ( metro line B) and the company name is Cotral. It costs € 2 to € 3per journey. Car rental : We recommend this option if you’re planning on renting a car for a few days, otherwise it is quite expensive and isn’t worthwhile. You can rent a car here . Although it is also possible to go by train, it takes 1 - 1.5 hours, costs € 3 and leaves you further away from Villa d’Este than the bus. If you’d also like to visit Villa Adriana , there is a bus connecting both mansions for € 1.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/santa-maria-cosmedin,1,"Santa Maria in Cosmedin - Bocca della Verità, Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria in Cosmedin The Basilica di Santa Maria in Cosmedin (Saint Mary in Cosmedin) is a minor basilica built during the Middle Ages, renowned for La Bocca della Verità , located on the north side of the church. Interesting facts The name Cosmedin comes from the Greek word “kosmidion”, meaning ornamented, thanks to its beautifully decorated interior. Nowadays, the church is practically bare, although it still has some magnificent elements such as the floor mosaics, the bishop’s chair, the baldachin and the medieval choir enclosure. Another treasure worth discovering is the glass shrine with the skull of St Valentine, patron saint of love, located on the left side of the church. The restored Medieval façade has a portico with seven arches, in which visitors queue to place their hand in the mouth of the legendary Bocca della Verità (Mouth of Truth). Legend has it that if a person places his or her hand in the mouth of the statue and lies, the mouth will close and cut their hand off. Next to the church’s porch is an impressive Romanesque bell tower built during the twelfth century. Crypt The crypt, constructed in the eighth century, is located beneath the altar and was built to store the relics taken from the catacombs by Pope Adrian I. The crypt is shaped like a small basilica. The side walls have several niches, each with shelves made of marble, where the different relics are displayed. Definitely worth visiting The church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and The Mouth of Truth should be on all the visitor’s itineraries.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/monumento-vittorio-emanuele-ii,1,"Altare della Patria - Opening hours, price and location - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Altare della Patria Inaugurated in 1911 to pay respect to Victor Emmanuel II, the Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II (Altare della Patria) is an imposing building located in Piazza Venezia . It provides some breath-taking views of Rome. The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele was inaugurated in 1911 as a tribute to Victor Emmanuel II , the first king of Italy after the country's unification. Inside the building is the Institute for the History of the Italian Risorgimento and the Central Museum of the Risorgimento. Since 1921, the Victor Emmanuel Monument holds the tomb of the unknown soldier , a place in which the eternal flame shines and which is always guarded by two soldiers. A spectacular monument The colossal monument, which is 135 meters wide and 70 meters high , is comprised of scores of majestic Corinthian columns and endless stairs , all carved in white marble . The top is crowned with an equestrian sculpture of Victor Emmanuel cast in bronze and two chariots driven by the goddess Victoria. The monument was strongly criticised at its construction, since it was necessary to knock down numerous valuable buildings to make sufficient space, and Italian citizens did not agree with the idea of having such an eye-catching and elaborate building next to the other classical buildings that surround it . Panoramic terrace One of the greatest attractions of the Monument to Victor Emmanuel is the panoramic view that can be seen from the terrace located at the same height as the chariots . The panoramic elevators are the only way to reach the upper part of the monument, but the amazing views make it worth the effort to climb . The Museum of the Risorgimento The base of the monument holds the Museum of the Risorgimento; a museum dedicated to the unification of Italy in which weapons, flags and other objects related to this historic moment are exhibited. Though it may be an essential visit for Italian citizens, is not too interesting for foreign visitors. Cannot be ignored The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the most eye-catching buildings of the whole city . Its impressive dimensions and the sight of the sun reflected on its white marble make it the subject of thousands of photographs taken by tourists each day .

Rome,https://www.rome.net/bus,1,"Rome Buses - Routes, hours, fares & map of the city buses in Rome Civitatis Rome Public Transport Rome Buses Rome has currently over 350 bus lines and it can sometimes be a bit confusing to find the right bus. Find out the main bus lines in Rome, their schedules and frequencies and tips to help you get around the city on this type of public transport. Since the metro lines of Rome are rather limited, visitors will most likely need the bus public transport system to get to certain parts of the city. It may not be the most comfortable or punctual form of transportation . Nevertheless, to get to certain monuments and museums it is essential to use the bus . Currently, Rome has 338 bus lines that run throughout the day, 22 night buses and 8,260 stops . While the size is impressive based on the numbers alone, delays and long waits are also worth mentioning as quite common occurrences. Presently, Rome has introduced a fleet of electric vehicles . Types of buses In Rome there are various types of lines, these are the most popular: Urban lines (U) : The large majority. They start between 5 am and 6:30 am and finish at midnight. It's important to note that the frequency varies. Night buses (N) : These lines operate while the urban lines ""rest"", that is to say, between midnight and 5:00-6:00 am. They operate with very little frequency but are very punctual. Express (X) : These lines are for the outskirts of Rome, for longer journeys. Exact (E) : These lines link the centre with the surrounding neighbourhoods. They run on fixed timetables. How to catch a bus? Are the bus lines in Rome the most complex in Europe? They might just be. Fortunately, each stop provides detailed information about the bus lines that serve it. This includes the route, operating days, and the schedule for the first and last buses. While this information seems straightforward, the reality on the ground can be different. When you've been waiting for half an hour without seeing a bus, you'll understand the challenge. Luckily, many bus stops are being upgraded with electronic displays showing the time until the next bus arrives. Buses also transmit their location to dispatchers, who notify passengers in three different ways In arrivo : the bus is arriving 3 Fer 2' : 3 stops away (fermate), arriving in 2 minutes A capolinea : the bus is at the first stop along its route Where to buy a bus ticket? Bus tickets can be bought in any metro station, newsstand or convenience store . If you are planning on using the bus regularly, we recommend you buy a few at a time or get a travel card , which might be a better option.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/weather,1,"The Weather in Rome - Weather averages and forecast Civitatis Rome General Information Plan your trip The Weather in Rome Rome has a Mediterranean climate with cool winters and generally hot summers , which means that any time of year is good for visiting the city. If we compare the climate of Rome to that of London, Dublin, Amsterdam or other northern European cities, temperatures are much more pleasant throughout the year with average high temperatures of 12°C (53°F) and average lows of 4°C (39°F) during the coldest months (January and February) and average high of 31°C (88°F) and average lows of 20°C (68°F) during the hottest summer months (July and August). The wettest month in Rome is December, and on average autumn and winter precipitation levels are higher than in London. Rome in winter Rome’s coldest months are January and February. During these two months, it rains every couple of days but some days can be quite pleasant with high temperatures of 12°C (53°F). At night, the temperature can reach below freezing. If you don’t mind a little bit of cold, Rome is beautiful during winter. Rome in summer July is the hottest month of the year in Rome, although August is nearly as hot, with average temperatures of 25°C (77°F). Due to the high humidity, visiting the city during these months can be a little stifling. In August, many shops close and many locals leave on vacation. The Best Time of Year to Visit Rome The city of Rome can be discovered the whole year round . However, if you can, we recommend going in spring or autumn, when there are normally fewer hordes of tourists. However, if you don’t like large crowds, avoid visiting the city during Easter as this is when Rome has the largest amount of travellers. In autumn, it is more likely to rain than in spring. Language Public Holidays You may also be interested in Language Although the official language spoken in Rome is Italian, travellers will find that many locals speak English, especially those who work in restaurants, hotels and other places associated with tourism. Public Holidays It’s always interesting to find out the public holidays of the place you’re travelling to beforehand. This allows you to make the most of holidays and also gives you an idea of when museums and other places of interest are closed.

This last palace features one of the best archaeological and classical art collections in the world. The Palazzo Massimo is also called Palazzo Massimo alle Terme due to its close proximity to the Baths pf Diocletian. The villa is a superb Neo-Renaissance-style palace, erected between 1883 and 1887. It was used as a Jesuit college until 1960 and in 1981 it was transformed into part of the National Roman Museum. Exhibitions The various exhibitions of the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme are divided into different themes and organized chronologically throughout the four floors of the museum. The basement houses a collection of jewels, grave ornaments and Roman coins from different periods. This might be considered to be the least interesting floor of the museum. The ground and first-floor feature famous Greek and Roman sculptures and statues, as well as impressive sarcophagi and high reliefs. The second floor showcases the best preserved Roman frescoes in the world, which are considered the highlight of the museum. Originally located in the Villa of Livia and Villa Farnesina , these colourful frescoes, sometimes covering an entire room, represent different paradisiacal landscapes and domestic life.

Located in a building east of the Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish Steps , the museum contains many reminders of the lives of both poets and other writers of the time. History In November 1820, the English poet John Keats moved to Rome believing that the warm Italian climate would improve the health problems he suffered due to tuberculosis. Within less than a year he died in the same house where he lived, and in accordance with the laws of the time, his belongings were burned to prevent the spread of the disease. In 1906 the house was purchased by an American poet who restored it and turned it into the memorial it is today. During World War II, the house had to be hidden to prevent its destruction and the objects that were kept were sent to an abbey, where they remained hidden until 1944. Exhibitions The Keats-Shelley House has a large collection of manuscripts, first editions, sculptures and paintings depicting the lives of the poets to which it pays homage. The house also has one of the finest libraries of Romantic literature in the world, to which thousands of volumes are added every year. Not a must-see Unless you're a big lover of literature, Keat-Shelley House isn't one of the must-sees in Rome. We only recommend it to those who have an extended time in the city.

The Piazza di Spagna (English: Square of Spain) is one of Rome’s most renowned squares . The name comes from the Palazzo di Spagna, the seat of the Spanish Embassy for the Vatican located on this square since the seventeenth century. The Piazza di Spagna is found in one of the most popular neighborhoods of Rome , near the high streets Via dei Condotti , Via Frattina and Via del Babuino , which houses several impressive seventeenth and eighteenth century villas. If you walk down Via del Babuino, you’ll arrive at Piazza del Popolo . In the centre of the square is the Flaminio Obelisk, one of the tallest obelisks in Rome, which was housed in the Circus Maximus . To get some of the best views of Rome, climb the steps from Piazza del Popolo to the top of Pincian Hill . Spanish Steps The Spanish Steps (Scalinata di Trinità dei Monti in Italian) were built at the beginning of the eighteenth century connecting Piazza di Spagna and the Church of Trinità dei Monti. It is one of the most famous parts of Rome. Every July, the square and the 135 steps are decorated to receive the Donne Sotto le Stelle fashion show. The staircase is a favourite spot among tourists to sit, relax and enjoy the views of Piazza di Spagna .

The mansion houses valuable works by great masters such as Raphael , Tiziano , Caravaggio , Brueghel the Elder , Velazquez and Bernini . The Exhibitions The Galleria Doria Pamphilj collection was started by Pope Innocent X Pamphilj in 1644. It currently consists of over 400 paintings dating from the 15th to the 18th century . Oddly, the paintings are in an order that has not changed over the course of time . This can be proven through an 18th-century document that details the exact placement of each one of the paintings. One of the most noteworthy works in the gallery is the Portrait of Pope Innocent X , by Velázquez , which shows the pope exactly as he was : an ominous and distrustful man . This led to a great deal of controversy at the time of its painting, given that other artists purported to idealize the pontiff’s characteristics in order to soften his sinister visage. Despite the painting’s realism, the Pamphilj family keeps it in a special place, and it has had its own room since the 19th century. In addition to the full gallery, within the palace, you can also visit a small chapel and several private rooms that maintain their original decor and part of their furniture . Not Worth Visiting The Palazzo Doria Pamphilj maintains a good deal of its original decor and showcases a large amount of artwork. Nevertheless, the entry fee is too expensive relative to the quality of the exhibits . Rome has important galleries that are superior to the Galleria Pamphilj.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/metro,1,"Rome Metro - Lines, hours, fares and Rome metro maps Civitatis Rome Public Transport Rome Metro The Metro of Rome only has three lines and is currently the smallest metro system in Europe. Nevertheless, it reaches the city's most important landmarks. Opened in 1955, the metro (subway or underground) in Rome has grown slowly over time, and currently only operates 37,3 miles (60 km) made up of three lines . It is one of the smallest metros in Europe. Currently, there are plans to expand the subway system . The reason why it's so limited is that each time a new tunnel is built, more archaeological remains are found; something which also happens in Athens . Most important metro stations Although the metro only comprises three lines, it gets to most of the city’s top attractions. These are the most important stops to keep in mind: Line A (Orange) The most used by both locals and tourists. It runs through Rome stopping at 27 stations going from northwest to southeast. Starting at Battistini and going to Anagnina, the line runs with a frequency of 3 minutes to 5 minutes depending on the day of the week. The most important stops starting from the west are: Cipro - Musei Vaticani : The closest stop to the Vatican Museums and to the Sistine Chapel. Ottaviano - San Pietro : This station is a few minutes’ walk from St. Peter's Square and St. Peter's Basilica. Spagna : Very convenient for visiting Piazza di Spagna and Villa Borghese. Barberini - Fontana di Trevi : This station is five minutes away from Trevi Fountain It is also the closest station to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Termini: Stops at Roma Termini railway station. Here, visitors can take the Leonardo Express to get to Fiumicino Airport. Line B (Blue) Running from northeast to south, line B goes from Laurentina to Rebibbia or Jonio, as it's also divided into two. It has 22 stations plus an extension of four more. Frequency is 5 minutes on weekdays and about 9 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. The most important stops starting from the north are: Termini : Transfer point between two lines and arrival point of the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino. Colosseo : Located near the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Piramide : If you come in the FR1 regional train from Fiumicino, you will be able to take the metro from this stop. Line B1 was inaugurated in 2012 and trains split upon arrival at Bologna station, where one branch continues to Rebibbia and another to Jonio. Líne C (Verde) Inaugurated in 2014 , this line runs through Rome from the center to the east , connecting San Giovanni (line A) to Monte Compatri-Pantano. It's less significant for tourists since, until its completion, it mainly serves the eastern area with few points of interest. Trains run every 12 minutes, every day of the week Where to get a ticket? Tickets can be purchased at the subway stations, at newsstands, and in most corner shops.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/two-days-in-rome,1,"What to See in Rome in 3 Days - What to see in Rome in 3 days Civitatis Rome What to See in Rome in 3 Days Although the city is ideally seen in 4 or more days, sometimes visitors have only a weekend to see Rome . To make the most of your visit, check out our top tips for what to see in Rome in 3 days, including stops at the Vatican City! Arrival: Squares and Fountains By the time you’ve landed, found your hotel, and dropped your luggage off, there will probably not be enough time to visit any monuments. What should you do? The best plan is to take a walk through the city center and get to know its streets, squares (piazzas), and fountains. If you want to arrive at your hotel without any complications and as quickly as possible, we recommend checking out our transfer service from the airport in Rome to your hotel . If you'd prefer to save on this journey to the hotel, you can also get a bus for a good price: Buy tickets for the shuttle bus from Ciampino Airport to Rome . If your accommodation is in the outskirts, the best way to get to Piazza di Spagna is to get the metro (line A). If you’re staying in the city center, it might be a better idea to go on foot. Once in Piazza di Spagna, take the Via dei Condotti, one of the city’s most important high streets, until you get to the Via del Corso. Here, turn left. Walk down the street and cross the Piazza Colonna (where the Column of Marcus Aurelius is located). Two streets further down, turn to the left and take the Via delle Muratte. Walk a few meters until you are hit by a breathtaking sight: the Trevi Fountain . This is a great place to stop and enjoy the beauty of such a monument. If you are superstitious, you might want to throw a coin into the fountain. Walking back down Via delle Muratte, cross Via del Corso, and continue along Via di Pietra. Five minutes later, you’ll arrive at the Pantheon , the best-preserved monument from the Roman Empire. If you’d like to enjoy the views, you can order a cappuccino in one of the many terraces of the piazza. Leave the Pantheon via Salita de Crescenzi Street and follow the signs until you get to Piazza Navona . This impressive square houses the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the Fontana del Moro, and the Fountain of Neptune, as well as the Obelisk of Domitian. Exit the square from the south side (by the Fontana del Moro) and you’ll arrive at Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a wider street. If you head down this street, on the left side, you’ll come across the Area Sacra dell’Argentina , an excavation where you’ll be able to see the remains of Roman architecture from the Roman Republic. This area is especially beautiful when lit up. Continuing in the same direction you'll see the Monument to Victor Emmanuel II , a huge building built in honor of the first king of Italy. If you have time to spare, you can go and see the Piazza del Campidoglio . Choose a restaurant nearby and if you’re not too tired you can go and have a drink at Campo dei Fiori , one of Rome’s liveliest squares. If you'd like to explore with a guide on your first day in Rome, we recommend booking this night tour of Rome . Day 2: The Vatican City If you’re visiting Rome during the weekend, you should dedicate the first day, Saturday, to explore the Vatican City and its museums , since on Sundays the Vatican Museums are closed (apart from the last Sunday of each month). If you're only in Rome for 2 or 3 days, you should probably expect to wake up early. To make the most of your time in Rome, you should make it to the Vatican City no later than 9 am. The best way to get to the Città Vaticano is to take the metro to Ottaviano. Upon leaving the station, take the street with the same name until you arrive at St. Peter's Square . After having taken in the splendid views of St Peter’s Square, join the queue to enter St Peter’s Basilica, one of the holiest temples for Christendom. Inside the Basilica, it's definitely worth climbing to the top of the dome (446 ft - 136 m tall) to get a bird’s eye view of Rome and the Vatican City. The ascent is a little exhausting (especially if you choose the stairs), but it's also part of its appeal. When you come down from the dome you'll have to leave St. Peter's Square and follow the signs to get to the Vatican Museums. If you are lucky there won't be a long queue and you'll be able to enter more or less directly. If you like museums you can stay for hours or days, but remember at the end of the museum is Michelangelo's masterpiece: The Sistine Chapel . If you want to visit the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel without the long queues, we recommend this Vatican City guided tour . If you also want to enjoy the impressive St Peter's Basilica, you can opt for this more complete option: Tour with access to the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums and St Peter's Basilica . On finishing your visit to the Vatican, take Via della Conciliazione from St. Peter's Square. On this street is located the Castel Sant'Angelo (Castle of the Holy Angel) and the bridge, Ponte Sant’Angelo, a Roman bridge that is considered one of the most beautiful ones in Rome. The castle is now a museum, definitely worth exploring. We also recommend checking out this Castel Sant'Angelo tour (with Terrace Access included) . Cross the bridge and follow the signs to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon , which you can visit. If there are still some hours of daylight and you wish to relax a bit, head to Villa Borghese , one of Rome’s most romantic public parks. Here you can lie on the grass or go for a stroll and discover its lake and numerous buildings. If you’re traveling with children, they will love this green space. Borghese Gallery guided tour At night there is nothing better than to wander through the city streets taking in Rome’s lively atmosphere and extraordinary architecture. If you didn’t have time to visit Campo dei Fiori the previous day, why not go today and have a relaxing drink? Day 3: Imperial Rome If you enjoy history you'll have left the best for the last day, since today we shall visit the Roman Forum , the Palatine Hill , and the Colosseum . As soon as you leave the station you'll have before you the great wonder of ancient Rome: the Colosseum . If you find a long queue at the Colosseum (more than 15 minutes) you can visit the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill first. The entrance fee is shared and you can then return to the Colosseum without waiting in line. To enjoy this experience to the max without long queues, we recommend booking the most popular guided tour in Rome: Guided tour of the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill . After finishing these visits you can access Capitoline Hill from the north side of the forum. When you get to Piazza del Campidoglio don't miss the statue of Romulus and Remus , located just before entering the square and often missed due to its location. Take the “Cordonata” stairs that lead to Via del Teatro Marcello and stay on the left side of the street. In less than 10 minutes you'll get to Santa María in Cosmedin, where the Mouth of Truth is found. Once you’ve visited the church, cross the river Tiber and you’ll find yourself in Trastevere , one of Rome’s most charming neighborhoods. The atmosphere is very lively and the restaurants are good quality and have very affordable prices. You can finish by having an ice cream in Santa Maria in Trastevere Square. If your flight doesn’t leave until late, we recommend going to the ruins of the Circus Maximus or the Baths of Caracalla . If you want to enjoy the city to the fullest but prefer not to do it on foot, the Rome tourist bus is the ideal option to visit the main places of interest in complete comfort.

It is one of the city’s four major basilicas. Going back in time Built on a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Cybele, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore was built in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Pope Liberius. According to legend, the Virgin appeared before the Pope with the instructions for building the church, and the shape of the floor was designed based on a miraculous snowfall. Over the years, the basilica has had many different names, such as Saint Mary of the Snow (due to snow that led to the church’s shape), Santa Maria Liberiana (for Pope Liberius), St. Mary of the Nativity (because it received a relic of the Holy Nativity), and it was finally called Santa Maria Maggiore, as it is the largest of the 26 churches in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Inside The basilica displays varied architectural styles, from early Christian to Baroque. The entire building was restored and renovated during the eighteenth century, so the facade and much of the interior date from that period. Despite this, the church retains the bell tower, some mosaics and marble floors from the medieval period and some Ionic columns from other ancient Roman buildings, as well as splendid fifth-century mosaics. The ceiling decoration has been preserved from the Renaissance period, while the domes and chapels belong to the Baroque era. A successful mix of styles Probably the most striking aspect of the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore is the different parts belonging to such varied periods of history. As if it were made up of remnants, the church summarizes the most important stages of Christian art in Rome.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/roman-empire,1,"Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire was founded when Augustus Caesar proclaimed himself the first emperor of Rome in 31 BC and came to an end with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. An empire is a political system in which a group of people are ruled by a single individual, an emperor or empress . The Roman Empire began with the reign of Emperor Augustus. The power of the Senate was limited and became an organ to support the emperor. The period between Augustus and Diocletian is called the High Empire, while the Low Empire is the era between Diocletian and the fall of the Roman Empire in the West. The High Empire (31 BC - 305 AD) The Roman Empire at its territorial peak Between the years 14 and 68 the heirs of Augustus succeeded him: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. This dynastic succession was interrupted when emperor Nero died and a civil war broke out in the year 68. Three emperors fought for power and finally, the war was won by Vespasian, part of the Flavian dynasty. The Flavian dynasty was succeeded by the Antonines (96 – 193) , a generic name given to Nerva , Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus . These emperors had a very similar policy to the Flavians. The accession of Septimius Severus (197 - 235) made him the first of the Imperial Severan Dynasty to rule (197 - 235). He was replaced by Caracalla, Macrinus, Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. The absolute power of Rome, the capital of the Empire, was weakened over time. Between 235 and 300 Rome’s only priority was to defend its borders from the continuous attacks by the Barbarians and from the Sasanians (from Persia). The pressure of these raids prompted the army to assume power in 235. This era is known as the military anarchy and lasted about 50 years. The emperors of this time had one sole purpose: fighting the Empire’s enemies and securing the borders. As a consequence of these constant wars, the army was very expensive to maintain, and thus the Empire became crippled with debts. This in turn impoverished the population and many lost their identity and values. Many were put in doubt of their religious beliefs, especially with the arrival of new doctrines from the East. The persecution of an ever-growing Christian minority by Diocletian was a way to rid the empire of the dangers it was facing . In 284 a military revolt saved the Empire and Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. During his rule he instaured the Tetrarchy, a form of government that divided the power. Diocletian designated the general Maximian to take charge of the western regions of the Empire, while the emperor governed over the eastern regions. Years later, he would appoint two Caesars. Diocletian abdicated in 305, revealing that the Tetrarchic political system didn’t work without someone to lead it. The Low Empire (305 AD - 476 AD) After the abdication of Diocletian in 305, a series of conflicts took place until 312, when Constantine became the sole emperor of the West. He was to be the last emperor of the unified empire. He instituted Christianity as the official religion of the Empire. The capital of the Empire is moved to the ancient city of Byzantium , which is reconstructed. Byzantium, from November 8th, 324, was renamed Constantinople or the city of Constantine.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/roman-forum,1,"Roman Forum - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there – Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Roman Forum Located between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum, the Roman Forum was the hub of political and social activity of the Roman citizens. Book a Tour The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place . The Forum is, along with the Colosseum , the greatest sign of the splendor of the Roman Empire that can be seen today. After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that excavations were carried out. Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima , one of the first sewer systems in the world. Points of interest Besides the great number of temples that are in the forum (Saturn, Venus, Romulus, Vesta, etc.), it's worth paying special attention to the following points of interest: Via Sacra : This was the main street in ancient Rome that linked the Piazza del Campidoglio with the Colosseum. Arch of Titus : This is a triumphal arch that commemorates Rome's victory over Jerusalem. It was built after the death of the emperor Titus. Arch of Septimius Severus : An arch erected in the year 203 A.D. to commemorate the third anniversary of Septimius Severus as the emperor. Temple of Antoninus and Faustina : Built in the second century, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina sets itself apart as the best-preserved temple in the Roman Forum. Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine : Though now mostly destroyed, its size suggests that this was one of the most important buildings of the Roman Forum. The Curia : In this building, the Senate met to make administrative decisions about the Roman government. Column of Phocas : Erected in the year 608 A.D. in honor of the emperor of Byzantium, this column, which is over 13 meters high, is one of the few that have remained standing since being built. A must-see Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower . As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there . The Roman Forum is one of the most beautiful and interesting places in the city, making it easy to spend hours strolling through its various temples without getting bored. Skip the Lines The best way to skip the line and get to know the Forum in detail is to take a guided tour . We'll visit three of the main monuments in the city, the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill, skipping the line, and all with an expert guide.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/santa-maria-degli-angeli,1,"Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was designed by Michelangelo and is the only Renaissance style church in Rome. The temple, located very near Piazza della Repubblica , is one of the most surprising and unique in the city thanks to its ruined façade that contrasts with its vast and sensational interior. Construction of the temple The site where Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was erected was where the Baths of Diocletian had been founded, an impressive demonstration of the glory of the Roman Empire until, in an intent to conquer Rome, the Goths cut the water supply of all the aqueducts of the city, and the baths had to be abandoned. When neglected, the baths were taken over by bandits and courtesans until the Renaissance, when the grounds were bought by the French cardinal Jean du Bellay, who commissioned the construction of a beautiful villa and its gardens. A Sicilian priest suggested building a church on the site of the Baths of Diocletian, in honour of all the Christian slaves who died while building the baths. Several decades later, in 1560, the priest’s efforts were rewarded by Pope Pius IV who commissioned Michelangelo to transform the baths into a church. Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli The interior of the church is remarkable and completely unpredictable from looking at its bare façade.  With an impressive dimension, the temple is beautifully decorated with vast frescoes on its walls and enormous coloured marble columns. On the floor, visitors will be able to see the meridian solar line built by the astronomer and philosopher Francesco Bianchini in 1703.  Bianchini’s meridian would tell when noon was throughout the year, the arrival of the solstices and equinox, as well as a calendar. Santa Maria degli Angeli houses an impressive organ, recently bought, with 5,400 tubes. It is capable of leaving the church’s visitors who are lucky enough to hear it spellbound. A very special temple There are countless churches of all sizes and from different periods in Rome, but, without a doubt, Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is one of the most remarkable and impressive churches in the city.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/history,1,"The History of Rome - From the Roman Empire up to the present day Civitatis Rome General Information The History of Rome How was Rome founded? How did it become an Empire? What was the role of the Catholic Church throughout Rome’s history? Learn about the fascinating past of this striking city before you travel to Rome. The exact origins of the city of Rome are still somewhat of a mystery . There are several theories all based on the writings of ancient authors and the archaeological discoveries . For this reason, the founding of Rome is based mainly on legend and myth , instead of solid facts and figures. The existence of a Roman Kingdom was even questioned for practically two centuries by expert historians. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they dismissed the idea of the early kings of Rome (Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius) as well as the date of the founding of what would later become the capital of Italy, in 753 BC. This part of history was merely considered a legend and not taken seriously. It was only during the late 20th century when, thanks to the findings of numerous archaeological digs and other sciences, the myths surrounding the establishment of the city and its first rulers were reconsidered . It's believed that the first inhabitants of Rome came from various parts of the region, and had neither the economic nor the cultural development of their northern neighbours, the Etruscans, nor the southern civilization called the Sabines and Latins. In Palatine Hill , archaeologists found the remains of a primitive settlement from the 8th century BC , with burials on the outskirts of the village. It's thought that as the population grew, the inhabitants settled on the slopes of the nearby hills, and during the next century they established themselves in the valley. The history of Rome in stages Romulus and Remus Legend or not, Romulus and Remus, twins who grew up raised by a she-wolf, have gone down in history as the founders of Rome. The Monarchy (753 BC - 509 BC) When the city of Rome was founded in 754 BC, it had a monarchical form of government. Find out how the Monarchy was overthrown and what came next. Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Romans created a republican government after the overthrow of the Monarchy. During this period the legal system of ancient Rome was established. Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire is one of the greatest civilisations of all time, starting with the Republic's fall in 27 BC and ending with the last Emperor in 476 AD. The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and moving the capital to Constantinople, the Pope became more powerful in Rome over the following years. Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870. Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world.

The church is also known for its famous sculpture of Michelangelo's Moses. Origins of the Basilica According to legend, Empress Eudoxia gave Pope Leo I the chains with which Saint Peter had been shackled in Jerusalem as a present, and to house these, he commissioned San Pietro in Vincoli Basilica to be built. When Pope Leo I held these chains near Peter’s chains from the time he spent in Mamertime Prison in Rome Inside San Pietro in Vincoli The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is different from any other church built during the same period thanks to its simplicity and scarce decoration. Under the main altar is the reliquary in which the chains of Saint Peter, the church’s most important element, are kept. Another impressive part of the church is the mausoleum of Pope Julius II, made up of Michelangelo’s striking statue of Moses, designed between 1505 and 1515. The mausoleum is dimly lit until one of the visitors makes a donation and it lights up, something which is done throughout most of the churches in Rome. Among the small altars found on both sides of the church, we recommend taking a close look at those found on the left-hand side. Visitors will see frescoes depicting skeletons and other images which are not very commonly shown in Catholic churches. Well worth visiting The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is well worth visiting not only because of its unique decoration and Michelangelo’s massive statue of Moses, but because it is unlike any other Roman church.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/villa-adriana,1,"Villa Adriana (Tivoli) - What to see in Tivoli from Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa Adriana (Tivoli) Nowadays, an important Roman archaeological site, Villa Adriana was commissioned by the Emperor Hadrian as a retreat from his palace in the capital. Book a day trip Located just outside of Tivoli, Villa Adriana is a collection of classical buildings created in the second century under the orders of Emperor Hadrian. It was a “small town” consisting of palaces, fountains, and baths, as well as other structures that mimic various Greek and Egyptian architectural styles. The construction of Villa Adriana came about due to the fact that Adriano was unhappy in the palace on Palatine Hill, and he created it as his place of retreat. After his death, it was used by various successors, but eventually fell into disuse and ended up in ruins, which were looted. What to see in Villa Adriana With an area of 120 hectares (296 acres), on which there are reconstructions of the emperor’s favorite Greek and Egyptian buildings, Villa Adriana is a great architectural treasure that requires several hours for a visit. One of the most noteworthy parts of the villa, known as Canopus, is a copy of a sanctuary located near Alexandria. It's an enormous pool surrounded by columns and decorated with figures of the caryatids. Among the libraries, bathrooms, guest houses, gardens, fountains, and ponds, stands a structure known as the Maritime Theatre, a circular pool surrounded by columns with an island in the middle. On the island, there is a small Roman villa. The splendor of the past Although during the 16th century, many of the statues and marble elements of Villa Adriana were looted to decorate the nearby Villa d'Este, you can still see how magnificent the villa was during its peak. If you have time to take a day trip to Tivoli from Rome, we believe it's definitely worth visiting both Villa Adriana and Villa d’Este. If you have time, take the opportunity to have lunch at Tivoli! Getting to Villa Adriana There are several ways to get to Tivoli from Rome: Take a day trip : The easiest and most comfortable way to get to Tivoli from Rome is to take a day trip. This option includes hotel pickup, transport, an official English-speaking guide and entrance fees. The price of the excursion to Villa Adriana is € 125 per person and can be booked here: Hadrian's Villa and Villa d'Este Day Trip . Bus: The buses that make the journey from Rome to Tivoli are from the Cotral company, and they depart from the Ponte Mammolo station ( Metro line B). The fare is € 2 and the travel time is about 45 minutes. Rent a car: this option is a good one if you have it rented for more than just one day, if not, it's not worth it. You can rent a car in Rome by clicking here . Although it's possible to go by train from Rome to Villa Adriana, but we'd say it's not worthwhile. The trip is longer, about 1 hour depending on the train you take, although there are tickets from € 4. If you are visiting Villa d'Este, there is a bus that connects both villas for € 1.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/basilica-san-clemente,1,"Basilica di San Clemente - Basilica in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di San Clemente The Basilica di San Clemente is a minor basilica dedicated to Pope Clement I. This temple is remarkable because archaeologically, it records the history of Rome from the beginning of Christianity up until the Middle Ages. History During the second century AD, the site on which the church now stands was occupied by a Roman mansion owned by Titus Flavius Clemens, one of the first Roman senators to convert to Christianity. The house was used for Christian clandestine worship since being Christian at the time was forbidden. Approximately a century later, a temple dedicated to Mithras, an all-seeing Protector of the Truth, was built on the same site. It would remain in use for the performance of rites of initiation until the late third century. On the second floor of the mansion, a large room was built, which would later become a basilica commissioned by Pope Siricius after the end of Christian persecution in 313 AD. It is believed that the church was badly damaged during the Norman sack of Rome in 1084. It was thus abandoned and buried under the level of the streets of the city. Years later, a new church, commissioned by Pope Paschal II, was erected on the same site and finished in 1108. It is the same that still stands today. Interior At first sight, the Basilica of San Clemente looks like any other church in Rome. However, inside there are numerous and unimaginable treasures. The small temple is beautifully decorated with twelfth-century mosaics. The entrance to the fourth-century church is through the sacristy, in which, despite the cold, darkness and moisture, visitors will be able to see the numerous frescoes on the walls, as well as some fragments of mosaics that used to cover the temple floor. Not only is the old basilica open, but visitors can also see the ancient Roman villas made of old brick. In one of the rooms, water flows through the Cloaca Maxima, the main sewer system of ancient Rome. A walk through the past San Clemente is a unique attraction, definitely worth visiting. It not only offers a visit to a beautiful temple from the twelfth century, but visitors can also discover a fourth-century temple and an old Roman mansion, walking down dark and humid passageways.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/ostia-antica,1,"Ostia Antica - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Ostia Antica Once the harbour city of ancient Rome, Ostia Antica is now a vast archeological site, located near the city of Rome. The town was abandoned and buried for over ten centuries until it was rediscovered. Book a guided tour Nowadays, Ostia Antica is a large archaeological site. Located just 19 miles (30 km) west of Rome and on the River Tiber. During ancient Rome, it was one of the most thriving cities in the region thanks to its status as Rome’s harbour city. After the collapse of the Empire, the city fell into decadence, was eventually abandoned and remained untouched and magnificently preserved for centuries. History Ostia Antica became Rome’s main seaport during the Roman Republic (509 BC – 27 BC) and the city was largely improved by Julius Caesar and Tiberius, during part of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, the Romans slowly began to depend on other ports, meaning that the commercial activity in Ostia slowed down until it fell into decay during the fourth century AD. During the same period, the inhabitants of Ostia were hit by malaria and many fled to save their lives. This is how a city which had once a population of 100,000, was abandoned and turned into a forgotten port during several centuries. The city is relatively well preserved, but not as well as Pompeii or Herculaneum , where the cities were completely buried under volcanic ash and mud. What to see The archaeological site still houses the remains of most of the city’s buildings before it was abandoned. Ostia’s main arterial street, called Decumanus Maximus in Roman cities, cuts through the whole city, while the arcades on both sides of the street show the houses and shops which once thrived here. There are also taverns, inns, shops, public baths and a large reconstructed theatre, which is still used during the summer. The harbour city had a very cosmopolitan population, visible thanks to a Jewish synagogue, a Christian Basilica and the 18 temples dedicated to the Persian god Mithra. Less interesting than Pompeii If you aren’t going to visit Pompeii or Herculaneum, then Ostia Antica is an archaeological site well worth visiting in which it is possible to imagine how the city’s inhabitants lived centuries ago. However, compared to Pompeii or Herculaneum, it is less impressive and less well preserved. If you visit the site during the summer, we recommend taking water and a hat to protect you from the sun, since there is little shade in the site. Directions from Rome Unless you have a car or wish to book a guided tour, Ostia Antica is very close to Rome and is easy to get to by public transport. To get there using public transportation take the metro (line B) and get off at Piramide. Here, take the Roma Lido commuter train to Ostia Antica. Once at the station, all you have to do is follow the crowd. It is a 10-minute walk away. The train to Ostia costs € 1.50 (like any other one-way journey ). Since you are going to use quite a lot of public transport, you might want to buy a day pass.

Built in the neighbourhood of Trastevere on the orders of a banker from Siena, the villa owes its name to its subsequent owner, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Touring Villa Farnesina The building consists of a central block, two small wings, and two floors. The interior of the villa is surprisingly richly decorated with frescoes by major artists, such as Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and Peruzzi . On the first floor there are particularly striking frescoes of the Sala di Galatea, one of Raphael’s most important works. When observing the ceiling, one can see astrological paintings showing the position of the stars on the day of the birth of Chigi, the villa’s first owner. On the upper floor there is another one of the villa’s most beautiful rooms, the Sala delle Prospettive. The room’s décor is based on the optical illusion created by the frescoes that show the city of Rome through the marble columns . Remarkable decor Villa Farnesina is an important manifestation of the luxury and opulence that predominated in Italian society during the Renaissance period . Although the building is of unremarkable size and its exterior is not particularly striking , the reason for visiting lies in the frescoes that cover the ceilings and walls that decorate the interior of the villa.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/piazza-campidoglio,1,"Piazza del Campidoglio - Square at the top of the Capitoline Hill Civitatis Rome Things to do Piazzas and fountains Piazza del Campidoglio The Piazza del Campidoglio was laid down on the summit of the Capitoline Hill, the most important of Rome’s seven hills. It is the first modern square to be designed in Rome . Book this guided tour The piazza came about because Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, organized a visit to Rome in 1536. Pope Paul III was so dismayed by the state of the sodden Capitoline Hill that he commissioned Michelangelo to design a square. The design of the square Michelangelo wanted the square to face St Peter’s Basilica , the political centre of Rome, instead of the Roman Forum.  He also proposed the construction of another palace, Palazzo Nuovo , which would face Palazzo dei Conservatori . This palace, in its turn, would have a new façade. The Palazzo Senatorio ’s front would also be redesigned so that all the buildings and the square would work harmoniously. An imposing bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was erected in the centre of the square. It is currently housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori and in the square stands a replica of the Roman Emperor instead. The execution of the plans took so long that Michelangelo didn’t live to see his work completed. Nevertheless, his designs were followed meticulously and finished several centuries later. Twenty-first century Piazza del Campidoglio The Piazza del Campidoglio is one of the most beautiful squares in Rome , attracting millions of visitors every year. Its popularity is also due to its proximity to the Capitoline Museums and the legendary sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf , situated between the Palazzo Senatorio and Palazzo Nuovo. The bronze she-wolf on top of the column is a replica. The original is housed in the Capitoline Museums.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/basilica-st-paul-outside-walls,1,"Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls Erected during the fourth century AD, the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls (Basilica di San Paolo Fuori le Mura) is one of the four major basilicas of Rome, and the second largest after St. Peter's Basilica . It was founded on the burial ground of St. Paul. Architecture When Paul the Apostle was executed in the first century AD in Rome, his followers built a shrine over his grave. In 324 a small church was consecrated on the same grounds, which was later demolished in 386 to make space for the construction of a larger and more beautiful basilica, completed in 395. The monastery’s striking cloister was built between 1220 and 1241. The cloister is one of the few parts of the Basilica which survived the fire of 1823. After the fire, many countries made donations for the restoration of the church, which was reopened in 1840. The temple was later declared a national monument. Interior The interior of the Basilica of St. Paul is magnificent, with enormous marble columns and beautiful gold mosaics. Unfortunately, because of the fire of 1823, few parts of the Medieval basilica remain intact. However, the church still houses some mosaics from the thirteenth century, a large twelfth-century chandelier, and the marble tombstone under which the remains of St. Paul lie. On the basilica’s walls, visitors will be able to observe the portraits of each of the popes, while a ray of sunlight lights up the portrait of the current Pope, Pope Francis. The atrium located in the exterior is one of the most noteworthy parts of the church. It is made up of 150 columns, and from here, visitors can see the façade of the Basilica covered by an enormous golden mosaic built between 1854 and 1874, which reflects the rays of sunlight. The centre of the portico houses a colossal statue of St. Paul. A little far away, but a must-see Although the Basilica isn’t in the heart of the city, we recommend visiting this unique and astonishing church in order to see its impressive mosaics, atrium and interior.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/papacy-rome,1,"The Papacy in Rome - Rome after the fall of the Empire Civitatis Rome General Information History The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and the transfer of the imperial capital to Constantinople, the Pope gained power and became the sole authority in Rome. Since the capital of the Eastern Empire was moved to Constantinople and what was left of the Western Empire was taken to Ravenna, Rome lost its power and the only authority left was that of the Pope , who consolidated his power with the help of the Lombards and Charlemagne. Until 751, when it was invaded by the Lombards, Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. In 756, Pepin the Short granted the Pope power over regions near Rome, giving rise to the Papal States. The development of ancient Christianity made the Bishop of Rome both religiously and politically important and established Rome as the centre of Christianity. Until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, Rome was the capital of the Papal States . Until the 19th century, the papacy was in a constant struggle with the Holy Roman Empire and other powers in Europe . Nonetheless, Rome became a very powerful and wealthy city, with great international importance. Factors that contributed to Rome becoming such an important place during the Papacy include: first, it became the most important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages , secondly, in 1300 Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the first Holy Year (Jubilee), a year of great importance for Christians; thirdly, the councils; fourth, the Papal patronage became the focus of rebirth replacing Florence and finally the cultural influence of the city itself. The papal authority continued to be extremely strong until the 19th century. The End of Papal Authority The French Revolution put an end to the papal power. With the 1848 revolution, Rome became part of the unified Italy. After the battle of Porta Pia in 1870 (a battle led by Pius IX to maintain his sovereignty over the Papal States) Rome was declared the new capital of Italy .

Rome,https://www.rome.net/pantheon,1,"Pantheon - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there – Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Pantheon The Pantheon, completed in 126AD, was a Roman temple with a surprising oculus that is the building's main source of natural light. The Pantheon of Agrippa , also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome . The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 B.C and that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D. At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who transformed it into a church , in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state of preservation. Architecture The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres . The dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica . At its top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building. The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: ""M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT"" , which means ""Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built this temple when he was a Consul."" The interior In the interior of the Pantheon the tombs of numerous Italian kings and a multitude of art works are found. The best-known person who can be found buried in the Pantheon is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael . A pleasant area The outskirts of the Pantheon are usually full of people at all hours, either photographing the imposing building or having a traditional supper in some of the terraces of the Piazza della Rotonda while they enjoy the shows put on by different street artists.

Its popularity drew new businesses to the area, opening workshops, inns and taverns making this neighborhood one of the most prosperous of the city. Moreover, Campo de’ Fiori was the location where a horse market took place twice a week. Public executions took place in this square , which is nowadays commemorated by the impressive statue of Giordano Bruno, in the centre of the piazza.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/roman-republic,1,"Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Roman Republic was installed after the Roman kingdom was overthrown in 509 BC and lasted until 27 BC . One of the most important figures of this period is Julius Caesar . According to tradition, in 509 BC a series of essential events took place in the history of Rome : the last monarch was expelled, Rome was taken by Porsenna's army , the treaty between Rome and Carthage was signed, the Consular Fasti began and the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated . It seems like a lot of events for such a short time. The only one that belongs with certainty to the year 509 BC is the dedication of the temple of Jupiter. The other events may have taken place later, albeit within a short period of time. The Fasti consulares (documents with the names of the consuls or magistrates that described the main events of the period) are essential for understanding the Roman Republic from 503 BC, from when they are considered credible. Another very important method used to understand this period of Roman history is the ritual of the clavus annalis . This practice began one year after the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated and it consisted in fixing a bronze nail to the right of the altar once a year. The first nail was placed in 508 BC. The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus had the cella of Jupiter, as well as the cella of Minerva and Juno. The decade after 509 BC (the year when the last King of Rome was dethroned, while he was away from Rome) is a dark period and very little is known, only isolated events. Transition to the Roman Republic The transition of Rome from a monarchy to a republic led to severe internal social tensions . This lack of control over the city led neighbouring tribes to siege the city and reduce its power. This is why Rome had to ratify its identity on numerous occasions during the first 70 years of the Republic. The early years of the Republic are of political turmoil. The population was divided, certain wanted a monarchy, others a republic, others favoured the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, and others wanted to form part of the Latin civilisation. The nobles who had overthrown the king and his family had not come to an agreement regarding the type of government that would replace the monarchy. The consuls, which would later replace the leadership of the Roman kings, were not put in place immediately, but many years later. Many historians believe that in the first stages of the Roman Republic, a praetor maximus was appointed for one year only. Later his duties would be split in two by choosing two consuls at a time to govern Rome. This form of government went on until 449 BC, with the Valeria Horaria law. The position of chief magistrate was not exclusively for the “ patres ”, who formed the Roman senate, and controlled the army and the priests since the time of Romulus , as there is evidence that shows plebeians, common civilians, becoming consuls up until 485 BC. The political instability led the strongest factions to form alliances between themselves. From 485 BC, the patricians no longer allowed commoners to take part in the government and began to control all civil and religious matters. Roman Law As well as the constant rivalry between patricians and plebeians, the Republic is also known as a period in which the power of Rome reached the whole peninsula of Italy and Roman law was founded with the Law of the Twelve Tables in 450 BC. Moreover, it was also a period when many wars took place for equality between the Roman inhabitants. The Twelve Tables were written up to appease the demands of the commoners. Until the Tables were written, Roman law had had a sacred character, as it had been linked to the monarchy and the college of pontiffs. With its drafting, Roman law was desacralised and became the basis of the law of the Western world. According to the historian Titus Livy, the Twelve Tables were the source of all Roman law, both public and private . Between the years 133 BC and 27 BC, Rome suffered from great internal tensions, leading to numerous civil wars. The Graco brothers, who proposed a series of laws in favour of the plebeians, also led to a social crisis in Rome. Dictatorship: Transition from the Republic to the Roman Empire The big step towards a political system in which power was accumulated in the hands of a single person was taken by Sulla (dictator in the years 82-79) . Sulla's systematisation was very important and one of the consequences, which greatly influenced politics and the very end of the Republic, was the fact that he concentrated all political power in the hands of the Senate, which was not the case with the executive government . This meant that the Senate had to entrust the executive to a natural-born leader, a general who was also a politician. At the same time, the Populares also wanted to occupy power, leading to a strengthening of personal power in governing. The strengthening of personalism led to the triumvirate and the dictatorships of Julius Caesar or Augustus and marked the end of the Republic and the beginning of a new era, the Empire .

Book this guided tour Roman circuses were the most important centres of entertainment in the Roman cities, apart from the theatres and amphitheatres. They were extended precincts in which the public games were held , consisting of chariot races and different spectacles. The Circus Maximus in Rome (Circo Massimo), located between the Aventino and Palatine Hills, was an extended precinct with space for 300,000 spectators . The arena, which measured 600 meters in length and 225 meters in width, made the Circus Maximus the largest in Rome, ahead of the Circus of Flaminius and the Circus of Maxentius. Celebrations in the Circus Maximus In the Circus Maximus several competitions were carried out, standing out among them chariot races , in which participants tried to complete seven laps of the Circus Maximus. The competitors , mounted in small chariots drawn by horses, gambled much more than their prestige or large prizes in the races, since many of them were slaves fighting for their liberty . During the public games, equestrian exhibitions , known as ""Ludus Troiae"", also took place. These were a simulation of various famous battles carried out by young Roman aristocrats. There were also foot races that lasted for several hours. The spectators would bet on the winners, making the competitions even more exciting. The importance of using your imagination Currently, the ruins of what was once the Circus Maximus barely remain. There is only the enormous terrace that keeps the form that it had in its day, which often causes disappointment for tourists who visit it hoping to find at least the ruins of the precinct.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/piazza-barberini,1,"Piazza Barberini - Square with two fountains created by Bernini Civitatis Rome Things to do Piazzas and fountains Piazza Barberini Named after the Barberini family , Piazza Barberini is especially renowned for its centerpiece, the Fontana del Tritone , which was designed by the sculptor Bernini. The Piazza Barberini, built in 1625 on the orders of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, is located at the end of Via Venetto. It is particularly striking due to the two fountains built by Bernini . A short distance from the square is the Palazzo Barberini , a splendid Baroque palace that houses the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica. The Fountains of Piazza Barberini In the centre of the square stands the Fontana del Tritone, sculpted in 1643 . Four dolphins hold up Triton, god of the sea, as he makes a jet of water shoot forth from a seashell. The fountain, made of travertine (sedimentary rock), is one of Bernini’s most notable ones . Hidden in one of the corners of the square is the Fontana delle Api (Fountain of the Bees), which is one of Bernini’s more modest works . Built in 1644 in honour of Pope Urban VIII, the fountain is decorated with large bees, which are the emblem of the Barberini family.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/church-of-the-gesu,1,"Church of the Gesù - The first Jesuit church built in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Church of the Gesù The Church of the Gesù was the first jesuit church in Rome, and is one of the most striking examples of barroque Roman art. Erected between 1568 and 1584, Il Gesù was the first Jesuit church built in Rome. It was lavishly decorated during the seventeenth century. Nowadays, the Church of the Gesù (Chiesa del Gesù) is considered to be one of the best examples of Roman Baroque architecture. In its interior Il Gesú was built with small chapels instead of aisles, designed specially so that the members of the church are all facing the main altar. One of the most striking parts of the temple is the ceiling fresco painted by Baciccia (Giovanni Battista Gaulli). The fresco manages to look three-dimensional thanks to the wooden figures and stuccos added to the fresco. Located in the chapel of the Madonna della Strada there is a small icon of the Madonna della Strada. The icon was built on the same site as Il Gesù and dates from the fifteenth century. It had originally been part of the church, which has the same name. The Chapel St Ignatius of Loyola (founder of the Jesuits) is a prime example of Roman Baroque architecture. In this chapel, the tomb of the saint is decorated with silver, gold, bronze, marble and some special stones. In the right transept is the altar of Saint Francis Xavier, one of the founders of the Jesuits. The altar features Jesus with St Ignatius and it has a silver reliquary with part of the saint’s right arm. In the heart of the city Il Gesù is not one of the most impressive churches in Rome, but its decoration and chapels are interesting to see. Another advantage is that is located in the heart of the city, near Piazza Venezia.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/mouth-of-truth,1,"Mouth of Truth - Bocca della Verità Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Mouth of Truth Situated in the portico of Santa Maria in Cosmedin Church, the Mouth of Truth (Bocca della Veritá) is a worldwide-famous enormous marble mask said to bite the hand of those who lied. The huge legendary sculpture has a diameter of 1.75 meters and is dedicated to the God of the Sea, represented by a male bearded face with holes for the eyes, nose and mouth . According to legend A husband who mistrusted his wife took her to the Mouth of Truth to test her faithfulness . The woman reacted by pretending to swoon and her lover caught her in his arms. After this, the woman swore before the Mouth of Truth that she had only been in the arms of her husband and of the man that had just caught her. This is just one of the many legends that exist regarding the famous sculpture that, with the passing of time, continues to generate enormous anticipation . Where is the Mouth of Truth? The sculpture was once located in the Piazza della Bocca della Veritá until 1632. It was then transferred to the outside of one of the walls of the nearby Santa María in Cosmedin , the place where it remains today.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/our-lady-conception-capuchins,1,"Our Lady of the Conception - The Crypt of the Capuchins, Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Our Lady of the Conception Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins (Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini), erected between 1626 and 1631, was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII. It is one of the most uncommon churches in Rome thanks to its unusual crypt. Interior The interior of this small church stands out because of its bare walls and discreet decoration, which contrasts greatly with the majority of the temples in Rome and their ostentatious ornaments. However, this is not what makes it so special. The main appeal of Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins is found in the church’s crypt, where many visitors will feel a chill down their spines as soon as they walk down to the ossuary. The Capuchin Crypt After the church was finished in 1631, Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin friars, ordered that the remains of the members of his order be moved from the cemetery to the church’s crypt. The bones were to be placed on the walls in a specific way, creating different motifs and designs full of religious symbolism, a site where the friars would come to reflect and pray. The crypt is divided into six pocket-sized chapels, decorated with the bones of 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870. The effect is as shocking as it is macabre. As well as the walls covered in individual bones, the chapels also house truly chilling whole skeletons dressed with the Capuchin brown habit. Despite what it might seem, the ossuary is an imaginative cult for the dead, which only seeks to demonstrate that the body merely contains the soul. Very popular The church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini is usually unnoticed by the crowds of tourists who seek to explore the macabre crypt and its décor of skeletons. Although this is a very unusual and unforgettable experience, it might be unsuitable for overly sensitive people.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/catacombs-rome,1,"Catacombs of Rome - Underground burial places Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Catacombs of Rome The Catacombs of Rome are former underground burial grounds that date from the second to the fifth century and were principally used by Christians and Jews. Book a Tour The catacombs are subterranean passageways that were used as place of burial for a number of centuries . The burials of Jewish, pagan and early Christian Roman citizens in the catacombs began in the second century and ended in the fifth century. The word catacomb, which means ""next to the quarry"", comes from the fact that the first excavations to be used as a place of burial were carried out in the outskirts of Rome, next to the site of a quarry . The reason for the catacombs The Christians did not agree with the pagan custom of burning the bodies of their dead, for which reason to solve problems created from a lack of space and the high price of land they decided to create these vast underground cemeteries. The catacombs possess a huge number of subterranean passageways that form real labyrinths that are several kilometres long , along which rows of rectangular niches were dug out . The corpses were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which were then covered with gravestones made of marble or, more commonly, baked clay. Subsequently, the name of the deceased was carved on the cover accompanied by a Christian symbol . Roman law at the time prohibited the burial of the deceased in the interior of the city, for which reason all of the catacombs were located outside of the walls. These separated and hidden places below ground constituted the perfect refuge in which the Christians could bury their own, freely using Christian symbols . The end of persecutions On signing the Edict of Milan in the year 313, the persecution of Christians ceased , and they could begin to build churches and acquire land without fear of confiscation. In spite of this they continued to use the catacombs as cemeteries until the 5th century . During the barbarian invasion of Italy in the 8th century many catacombs suffered continuous lootings, for which reason the Popes caused the still remaining relics to be transferred to the city's churches . After these transfers, some catacombs were abandoned completely and forgotten for centuries . Catacombs of Rome In Rome there are more than sixty catacombs made up of hundreds of kilometres of underground passageways that hold thousands of tombs. Currently only five of them are open to the public : Catacombs of San Sebastiano (Via Appia Antica, 136): These 12 kilometre long catacombs owe their name to San Sebastiano, a soldier who became a martyr for converting to Christianity. Together with those of San Callisto they are the best that can be visited. Opening times are Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antica, 126): With a network of passageways over 20 kilometres in length, the tombs of San Callisto were the burial place of 16 pontiffs and scores of Christian martyrs. Opening times are Thursday to Tuesday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Priscilla (Via Salaria, 430): These hold some frescoes that have great importance for art history, such as the first representations of the Virgin Mary. Opening times are Tuesday to Sunday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Domitilla (Via delle Sette Chiese, 280): Discovered in 1593, these catacombs, which are more than 15 kilometres in length, owe their name to the granddaughter of Vespasian. Opening times are Wednesday to Monday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Sant’Agnese (Via Nomentana, 349): After being a martyr because of her Christian faith, Sant’Agnese was buried in the catacombs that subsequently bore her name. Opening times are from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00; the catacombs are closed on Sunday mornings and Monday afternoons. How to get to the Catacombs To visit the catacombs, you have several options: Take a tour : reserving a visit is the easiest way of visiting the catacombs and monuments on the Via Appia. Here you can reserve a tour which includes transport, tickets, and an official guide. Public bus : although it's the cheapest way to get there, you can lose plenty of time heading there on your own. The 118 and 218 lines head to San Calixto and San Sebastián, and lines 218 and 716 go to Domitila. Taxi : the high price, and difficulty in finding a taxi for the return journey to Rome means we don't recommend this option. A walk through the insides of Rome The catacombs of Rome offer a very special visit in which the funeral remains of those buried many centuries ago can be seen. It is fascinating to travel through the dark and damp passageways, where you can see, in addition to the niches, some inscriptions with the names of the people that once occupied them. Due to the high infant mortality at that time, you can see a large quantity of spaces prepared for these children, alongside some larger graves in which the whole family was buried . During the visit, a guide who is specialized in the topic gives the visitors several interesting facts relating to the catacombs and the period in which they were operating . The guided tours are in Spanish and are included in the cost of entrance.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/sistine-chapel,1,"Sistine Chapel - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Vatican City Sistine Chapel Regarded as Michelangelo’s masterpiece, the Sistine Chapel (Cappella Sistina) is a jaw-dropping attraction you must see at least once in your lifetime. Book a Tour The Sistine Chapel is one of the greatest treasures of the Vatican City , of Rome, and of the world in general. It's known as much for its decoration, as for being the temple in which popes are chosen and crowned. The construction of the building was carried out between 1473 and 1481 during the mandate of Pope Sixtus IV , to whom it owes its current name. The architect responsible for the construction was Giovanni of Dolci and it's the only work that he is remembered for. The most striking thing about the Sistine Chapel is not its architecture, but the frescoes that completely cover the walls and the ceiling. Some of the most important artists who worked in the chapel are Botticelli, Perugino, Luca, and Michelangelo . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel All of the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are the work of Michelangelo , who spent four years painting the vault between 1508 and 1512. If there is one thing that stands out from among the images on the ceiling, it's the nine stories from Genesis that occupy the central area : The scenes from the Drunkenness of Noah to the Separation of Light from Darkness are represented. The Creation of Adam Without any doubt, The Creation of Adam is the best-known image from the Sistine Chapel . It's located in the central part of the vault and represents the story from Genesis in which God gives life to Adam. The Final Judgment Located over the high altar and with some magnificent dimensions (13.7 by 12.2 meters), Michelangelo’s other masterpiece , The Final Judgment, is found. It's a fresco that represents the Apocalypse of St. John. Decorating the apse occupied five years of Michelangelo’s life, between 1536 and 1541 . It was an assignment of Pope Paul III to cover the murals that existed to that point. Skip the lines If you're visiting the Sistine Chapel, you'll have to visit the Vatican museums, the most popular attraction in Rome and Europe.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/roman-monarchy,1,"The Monarchy (753 BC - 509 BC) - The history of the Roman Monarchy Civitatis Rome General Information History The Monarchy (753 BC - 509 BC) Discover the State of Rome’s first political model , which was a monarchical form of government , from 753 BC until 509 BC. The most accepted date for the foundation of Rome is 753 BC . The first form of government in Rome was monarchical according to the archaeological findings and the legends. In the excavations carried out in the Roman Forum , in the Regia, which was the former royal residence, a glass of bucchero was found dating from the 7th century BC with the inscription Rex (king). The word regei was also found on the Lapis Niger, an ancient shrine in the Roman Forum. An inscription found beneath the black marble is considered to be a law. It's also possible to figure out when Rome was a kingdom thanks to other institutions in the Lazio region. For example, the rex Nemorensis (king of the forest), a priest of the goddess Diana who looked after the forests from the 6th century BC until the Roman Empire. Curiously, the Romans would maintain the same institutions throughout the centuries, transforming the roles of those in charge to suit the period. In this case, during the Roman Republic, the figure of the rex sacrorum (king of the sacred) substituted the king figure but was only given religious functions. Romulus, son of the god of war and the daughter of the king Numitor, was the first king of Rome and also its founder, thus the city was called after him. He formed the Roman Senate with one hundred men and gave the inhabitants of Rome a body of laws. The Growth of Rome After founding the city, Romulus invited merchants and men of all kinds to settle in Palatine Hill. To increase the female population and give Rome’s inhabitants wives, he abducted Sabine women. As a consequence, the Sabine King , Titus Tatius attacked Rome and took the Capitol . Finally , Romulus shared the kingship of the city with Titus Tatius until his death. The list of the 7 kings of Rome, or 8 if we include Titus Tatius, is as follows: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, Tarquinius Superbus . No historian doubts the existence of the last 3 kings, since there is clear evidence of their reigns in Rome. Nowadays, it's also believed that the first 3 kings of Rome also existed. Certain historians argue that the name of these 7 kings dates back to when the first Roman historians, in the 3rd century BC, wrote about the origins of Rome, which would confirm them to be true. Roman Forum Roman Forum 2 See photo gallery Romulus and Remus Roman Republic You may also be interested in Romulus and Remus There are several fascinating legends and myths about how the city of Rome was founded, all collected by the Italian historian, Tito Livio.

Since that moment private families and other popes have enlarged the collection of the museums to the point where it has become one of the largest in the world . At present, the Vatican Museums receive more than 6 million visitors annually , partly due to the fact that they form the entrance to the Sistine Chapel . What museums are there in the interior?

Rome,https://www.rome.net/palatine-hill,1,"Palatine Hill - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there – Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Palatine Hill Palatine Hill , one of the oldest parts of Rome, towers 40 meters (130 feet) above the Roman Forum and is the most central of the famous seven hills. Book this guided tour Palatine Hill is considered to be the birthplace of the Italian capital and is believed to have been inhabited since the year 1000 B.C . During the Republican Period, Roman citizens belonging to the upper class settled in Palatine Hill and built sumptuous palaces , of which important traces are still preserved. According to the legend Roman mythology talks of the cave that was inhabited by Luperca, the she-wolf that took care of Romulus and Remus , which is located on Palatine Hill . According to the legend, when the brothers grew up they decided to form a city on the banks of the river, but when they could not come to an agreement on some points of the decision, Romulus killed Remus and founded the city of Rome . What to see on Palatine Hill On Palatine Hill, you can see hundreds of ruins of imposing buildings that were created for high Roman society in ancient times. Although the whole scene is impressive, these are some of the points that deserve special attention : Domus Flavia : The splendid palace Domus Flavia was built in the year 81 B.C . by the order of Emperor Domitian as a public and official residence. There are still some parts of the extensive construction that can be seen. House of Livia : This modestly-built house which was built in the 1st century B.C. is one of the best-preserved buildings in Palatine Hill. It's still possible to glimpse the remains of the mosaics and frescoes that at one time cheered up the ceilings and walls. House of Augustus : Built as the private residence of Octavian Augustus, the house built on two levels still has a large part of the valued and colorful frescoes that decorated its walls. Farnese Gardens : Designed in the middle of the 16th century on the ruins of the Palace of Tiberius, the Farnese Gardens were one of the first botanical gardens to be created in Europe. Hippodrome of Domitian : Given the appearance of a Roman circus, it's not known for certain if the stadium was created for holding races, or just to be used as a garden. Palatine museum : In this small museum, several discoveries that were made during excavations carried out on Palatine Hill are on exhibition. There are sculptures, frescoes, mosaics, and other objects belonging to the golden age of Palatine Hill. From Palatine Hill, you can get the best views of the Roman Forum from above . A walk in Ancient Rome Palatine Hill is a very pleasant place for a quiet stroll under the shadow of the trees while passing many of the preserved corners of ancient Rome. It's worth dedicating half a day to visit it since the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill each cover a very large space that should be very interesting . Guided Visits to Skip the Lines The best way to visit while skipping the lines is to reserve our tour , visiting the three main monuments in the city: Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill - all with a specialist guide. If you prefer visiting at your own pace, we recommend arriving first thing in the morning to visit the Vatican . This way you can hopefully avoid longer lines.

Bucais la parada número 12 que está muy bien señalizada y ya está! Te espera un trayecto de una hora hasta términi Translate this opinion into English. Getting to the stop where the car picks you up is very easy! Just leave the airport and head to terminal 3, then just look for the bus station which is in the same direction just a little further ahead of the entrance to terminal 3! Find stop number 12 which is very well signposted and that's it! A one hour journey awaits you to Termini. Opinion translated. Show original. I travelled with my partner 10 Dec / 14 / 2025 K Kamil London, United Kingdom Efficient booking and excellent customer care. It was straightforward journey from leaving the airport terminal to the coach platform, approx 3 minutes. Conveniently displayed on the platform form digital information with departure time. The staff at the airport coach plate form were professional- excellent English speakers, pleasant and courteous. The journey was pleasant and interesting. Arrived at Rome Termini at convenient time. I travelled with teenagers 10 Dec / 01 / 2025 C César Spain Los empleados fueron amables, resolviendo cualquier duda que tuviera. Llegué antes de tiempo y como había espacio me dejaron subir antes, me hicieron un gran favor así no estuve esperando en la calle. La parada está según sales de la T3 a mano derecha en unas columnas amarillas donde paran autobuses en el n. 12 Translate this opinion into English. The staff were friendly and helpful, answering all my questions. I arrived early, and since there was space, they let me board first, which was a big help as I didn't have to wait outside.

I travelled by myself 6 Nov / 14 / 2025 C Cristina Spain A la ida el bus que queríamos coger y que figuraba en el horario no existía, habiendo tal cantidad de gente que no íbamos a entrar en el siguiente y tuvimos que irnos en tren. Sin embargo al reclamar a Civitatis muy amablemente nos ofrecieron poder cambiar ese billete sin usar por el de la vuelta y en esa ocasión si existía y pudimos usarlo. Eso sí, el trabajador que estaba coordinando el bus entre Termini-Aeropuerto, bastante hostil. En resumen: bien por Civitatis, mal por el proveedor Translate this opinion into English. On the outbound journey, the bus we wanted to take, which was listed on the timetable, wasn't running. There were so many people that we wouldn't have been able to get on the next one, so we had to take the train. However, when we complained to Civitatis, they very kindly offered to let us exchange our unused ticket for the return trip, and this time the return ticket was available and we were able to use it. That said, the employee coordinating the bus between Termini and the airport was quite unfriendly. In short: good job Civitatis, bad job the supplier. Opinion translated. Show original. I travelled with my partner 8 Nov / 06 / 2024 M Marcos Ribes  Ballester Gandía, Spain Fue bien, pero al ser un aeropuerto tan grande, pese a llegar con tiempo, tuvimos que ir corriendo porque nos dejaron a la otra punta de donde se cogía el bus, no estaría mal, avisar en la contratacion del traslado, aparte de donde se coge el bus, que se informará de que el aeropuerto es muy grande para que puedan seleccionar hora de solicitar el traslado con mas tiempo, nosotros lo solicitamos en teoria una hora despues de la llegada del avion y aun asi llegamos justo Translate this opinion into English. It was fine, but since it is such a big airport, despite arriving on time, we had to rush because they left us at the other end of where the bus was taken. It would not be a bad idea to let them know when booking the transfer, apart from where the bus is taken, that they will be informed that the airport is very big so they can select a time to request the transfer with more time. We theoretically requested it an hour after the plane arrived and even so we arrived just in time. Opinion translated. Show original. I travelled with my partner Show all the reviews Book",1717

See Trajan's Column up-close Trajan's Column is almost 40 metres high. Its spiral bas-reliefs narrate in detail the unforgettable chapter of history in which the Roman Empire defeated the Dacians as if it were an open book. Originally, the more than 2,500 figures on Trajan's Column were decorated with bright colours, making it look even more magnificent. More than 50 of the figures depicted Trajan , the architect of the Roman people's victory over the Dacians. The depictions were particularly useful for those who could not read, vividly conveying the triumphant episode of the battle, allowing the populace to witness the might of Rome under the leadership of Trajan . At the time of its construction, the column was located inside Trajan's Market , but over the centuries, the imposing market fell into disrepair and a large part of the installations were lost, leaving the majestic column outside the complex. Despite the passing of almost 2000 years , Trajan's Column stands firm and in perfect condition to remain part of Rome's eternity while continuing to tell its stories to visitors who come to see it.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/ara-pacis,1,"Ara Pacis - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there – Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Ara Pacis The Ara Pacis is a commemorative monument that was built between the years 13 and 9 B.C. to celebrate peace in the Mediterranean after the victorious battles of Emperor Augustus in Hispania and Gaul. The Ara Pacis is an altar located in the interior of a closed structure carved in Carrara marble. It stands out because of its impressive decoration made up of various reliefs showing the family of Augustus in procession, in addition to different allegories related to the mythical foundation of Rome. Ara Pacis in the past Erected in the Campus Martius, the monument was dedicated to the Roman goddess of Peace. Each year, a ram and two oxen were sacrificed in the goddess's honor. The altar was located in such a way that the shadow of the great obelisk located in the Campus Martius was projected on the Ara Pacis on the birthday of Augustus. Due to the expansion of the river, the altar was submerged in mud, where it remained for more than one millennium. It was not until the 16th century that some of the remains were found and in 1938 its reconstruction was carried out, preserving it until the present day. Ara Pacis today Although the Ara Pacis is one of the most significant monuments of Ancient Rome, it's the only thing that is exhibited in the interior of the museum, making an entrance ticket quite expensive. It's best to look at the altar from the outside, as the building that contains it is made of glass. Ara Pacis Altar of Augustan Peace 2 See photo gallery Location Lungotevere en Augusta.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/basilica-st-john-lateran,1,"Basilica of St. John Lateran - One of Rome's important churches Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica of St. John Lateran The Lateran Palace was handed over by Constantine I to the Bishop of Rome, who converted the building into a temple during the fourth century. The Basilica is the oldest church in Europe. Founded during the fourth century in honour of St. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, St John Lateran (Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano) is the Cathedral of Rome and the most important of the four major basilicas. It is known as St John Lateran Archbasilica, as is it considered the mother church of the Roman Catholic faithful. History In the early part of the fourth century, the Laterani family were stripped of their land as one of their members was accused of conspiring against the Emperor. It was given to the Bishop of Rome in order to build the first Roman basilica. Throughout the centuries, St John Lateran has survived several fires and an earthquake in 897. Nevertheless, it still maintains its first form even though it has been reconstructed on several occasions. Near the Archbasilica there was a monastery, which has completely disappeared now; the only part still standing is its beautiful cloister from the thirteenth century.  The Basilica also houses a baptistery, which for many years was the only baptistery in Rome. The Basilica of St. John Lateran has played an important role throughout history; it was here that all popes were enthroned up until 1870. Nowadays, Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterno is where the Pope, as Bishop of Rome, celebrates Holy Thursday Mass. Interior The two-story portico on the Basilica’s main façade was constructed during the eighteenth century, and it is where the Pope blesses the congregation on Holy Thursday. On the top part of the façade visitors will see imposing statues of the Apostles and Jesus, also dating from the eighteenth century. The central doors made of bronze were previously used at the Roman Senate House (the Curia Julia) within the Roman Forum . The Basilica’s interior is magnificent with colossal statues, mosaics and frescoes from the ceiling to the ground, with impressive columns. The Holy Stairs (Scala Santa) are located near the Lateran Basilica. These are renowned because it is believed that Jesus Christ stepped on them during His Passion. They were relocated from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by St Helena.

This bath complex was the largest of ancient Rome. History The construction of the Roman baths began in 298 and was completed in 306. The structure of the baths was very similar to that of the Baths of Caracalla. They were made of bricks, coated in marble and decorated with mosaics and sculptures . The whole complex took up 120,000 square meters and included a gymnasium, a library, and cold, hot and tepid public baths . During the construction, thousands of Christian slaves died. Diocletian, ill and tired, abdicated in 305. The Roman public baths remained open until 537, when the Goths cut off the aqueducts in an attempt to conquer Rome. In 1561, Pope Pius IV ordered Michelangelo to build the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli on the remains of the baths to honour all the Christian slaves who died. National Museum of Rome Open to the public after thirty years of reconstruction, the 10th Hall of the Baths of Diocletian were made part of the National Museum of Rome in 2008. Nowadays, only a small part can be visited , in which it is possible to see the high ceilings the baths had. The interior of the remains includes an impressive funerary sculpture and two tombs decorated with frescoes and stucco, which are believed to date from the beginning of the second century AD. In the outdoor part of the baths it is possible to stroll through a sixteenth century garden with nearly 400 works of art , including statues, sarcophagi and reliefs. Impressive Even though the ruins show only a small part of the public baths complex, it is extremely impressive . Visitors can also explore the tombs, which are very well preserved.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/rome-capital-italy,1,"Rome as Capital of Italy - Recent history of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870 . Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world. The unification process of Italy started in 1848 and ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Since Rome was under the control of the Papacy, Florence was made the temporary capital of Italy. In 1870, Italian troops entered Rome, ending more than one thousand years of Papal control over the city. However, the Pope did not accept the unification of the peninsula and took refuge in the Vatican until February 11th, 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed by Mussolini and Pope Pius XI, creating the Vatican state . Mussolini and the National Fascist Party, allies of Nazi Germany, marched into Rome in 1922 and came to power in the country, declaring a new Italian Empire. During the following years many monuments , buildings and streets were restored and Rome became the administrative capital, increasing the population of Rome, from 212,000 inhabitants to over one million (during the Roman Empire, Rome had over 2 million inhabitants). During World War II, Rome was hardly bombed compared to other cities. This was largely due to the Americans not wanting to destroy Rome because in its centre was the neutral Vatican City and Pope Pius XII, who remained in the city throughout the war. Finally, on June 4th, 1944, Rome was taken by the Allies. In 1946, the monarchy was overthrown and a republic was put in place. During the 50s and 60s, a period known as the Dolce Vita (meaning the sweet life), Rome became a very fashionable city . Next, in the 1980s, the population grew reaching 2,800,000 .​ On March 25th 1957, the “Treaty of Rome” was signed in this city by 6 countries. It established the European Economic Community (EEC) and The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). The “Treaty of Rome” would later give birth to the creation of the European Union. Rome in the 21st Century Currently, Rome’s historic centre still reflects its colourful past. Visitors will find traces of ancient Rome , Renaissance palaces, fountains, piazzas , Baroque churches and other architectural styles dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. As the capital of Italy, Rome has most of the country's political buildings. The population has grown exponentially and now is at about 2.8 million.

It's fascinating to explore the catacombs, which are actually water reservoirs and help us understand how the Romans built on multiple levels over time. They didn't excavate but buried the earth to build on top. The guide will explain all of this. And then there's the Trevi Fountain in all its splendor.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/piazza-navona,1,"Piazza Navona - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Piazzas and fountains Piazza Navona Defined during the fifteenth century, the Baroque-style Piazza Navona is one of the most charming and popular squares in Rome . The public square is built on the site where the Stadium of Domitian (Circus Agonalis), founded in 86 AD, once stood. It could hold approximately 20,000 spectators, which came here to see different athletic competitions. Fountains of Piazza Navona The most beautiful parts of Piazza Navona are its three fountains, designed during the papacy of Gregory XIII : Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Erected in the centre of Piazza Navona, the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers) was designed by Bernini in 1651 . The four statues represent the most important rivers of the continents where Christianity had spread; the Nile, Danube, the Ganges and Rio de la Plata. In the middle there is an obelisk measuring 52 ft (16 m), which had originally been part of the Circus of Maxentius, found in the Appian Way Regional Park. Fontana del Moro Sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and later perfected by Bernini, who added the figure of the Moor, the fountain was initially called the “Seashell Fountain.” This fountain is located on the southern side of the square. Fontana del Nettuno The Fontana del Nettuno (Fountain of Neptune) was also created by Giacomo della Porta in 1574 , but remained unfinished for approximately three-hundred years, until 1878, when it was decorated by Antonio Della Bitta and Gregorio Zappalà. Interesting facts Until mid-nineteenth century, every summer the drains of the three fountains were blocked and the centre of the square was flooded to make the “Lake of Piazza Navona” . It was greatly enjoyed by the locals. A charming area The square is surrounded by restaurants and terraces giving Piazza Navona a lively and delightful atmosphere during the day. Here, visitors can enjoy performances by street artists like magicians and dancers. The most imposing buildings which look onto the square are the Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone and the Palazzo Pamphilj.

Rome is a breath-taking open-air museum and these are its top sights. Millennia of history, unbeatable cuisine, and much more, Rome is rightfully one of the most popular tourist destinations on the planet . With so many things to do and see in Rome, one of the most difficult parts of visiting the Eternal City can be crafting the perfect itinerary. Read on to discover our must-dos! 1. Visit the Colosseum An ever-enduring symbol of the grandeur of Ancient Rome, the Colosseum is perhaps one of the most recognizable landmarks on the planet, as well as one of the 7 Wonders of the World. This breathtaking amphitheater is right in the heart of the city, and once would have accommodated as many as 80,000 spectators. These giant crowds would watch on as the venue played host to everything from epic gladiator fights to public executions. With Civitatis, there are lots of different ways of visiting this bucket list landmark. You don’t need a guide to visit the Colosseum. However, to get the full experience, and to gain a deeper insight into the landmark’s history, we recommend taking this guided tour of the Colosseum , which includes a pass for the gladiator's entrance, meaning you'll get to walk where so many gladiators would have emerged into the arena, to the roar of up to 80,000 Romans cheering. If you'd prefer to explore it at your own pace, the entrance is included with the OMNIA Rome & Vatican Card . 2. Stroll Through the Roman Forum Just a stone's throw from the Colosseum, the Forum marked the heart of Ancient Rome's political, religious, and social spheres. It would have been in this very place that triumphal processions, public speeches, commercial affairs and much more would have taken place. Today, this sprawling archaeological site is made up of different streets that were once bustling at the height of the Roman Empire, temples, the courts of justice, and halls of government. Here are some activities that you may find useful to explore this complex and delve into its fascinating history. Colosseum, Roman Forum & Palatine Hill Tour Colosseum Tour + Gladiator's Entrance 3. Explore the Vatican Museums & the Sistine Chapel No trip to Rome would be complete without a visit to Vatican City. Due to its sovereign nature and limited size, it's considered the smallest country in the world . Despite this, it's home to impressive works of art and, of course, the Holy See, the central government of the Catholic Church. Of course, we must highlight the Vatican Museums, one of the most extensive art collections in the world. Raphael , Caravaggio and Leonardo da Vinci are some of the painters present in this exhibition. But the Sistine Chapel is undoubtedly the highlight. This room, where the cardinals hold the Conclave to elect the new Pope, is famous for its impressive ceiling fresco and the mural painting of the Last Judgement, both painted by the legendary Michelangelo in the 16th century. Words cannot explain it, it's pure beauty! There are multiple options when it comes to visiting this museum complex, as well as St. Peter's Basilica itself. To make your task easier, we have compiled the best tours of the Vatican for you: Vatican Museums & Sistine Chapel Guided Tour Sistine Chapel, Vatican Museums + St Peter's Basilica St. Peter's Basilica Guided Tour Papal Audience 4. Enter Rome's Pantheon The Pantheon is one of Rome's best-preserved ancient structures. Originally, the Pantheon was built as a temple dedicated to Roman gods and was later converted to a Christian church. Built almost 2000 years ago, this massive structure is still considered an architectural masterpiece. Perhaps its most astounding element is its crowning dome, which still boasts the title of having the largest unsupported concrete dome on the planet. You can visit the Pantheon by yourself for an entry fee of € 5. However, on this Pantheon Guided Tour , you can explore this iconic structure, including legendary artist Raphael's tomb, accompanied by an expert guide, who will give you valuable insights into its rich history. 5. Stroll Down the Spanish Steps The Spanish Steps represent one of the finest urban examples of Baroque architecture in Rome . The famous steps of the Piazza di Spagna, built in the early 18th century, are one of its most emblematic spaces and one of the most photographed places in the city. These steps connect the base of the square with the Church of Trinità dei Monti. Piazza di Spagna is a regular stop on a free tour of Rome , so we recommend taking this guided tour to learn a little more about this iconic landmark. In addition, the streets surrounding the square are home to a number of luxury shops and restaurants—what more could you ask for? 6. Throw a Coin into the Trevi Fountain This stunning Baroque masterpiece is another unmissable stop in the Italian capital city. A ten-minute walk from the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain as it stands today was completed in 1762, though it is said that the water source dates back to 19BC. You can see the fountain as part of this Free Walking Tour of Rome , during which you can take the chance to follow the tradition of throwing a coin into the water. According to legend, this act will ensure one's return to the city! 7. Piazza Navona Piazza Navona is a must on this list of places to see in Rome. It's considered one of the most beautiful squares in the capital of Italy —and the world! Full of bars and restaurants, this area is perfect for a break between monuments. However, the square is also impressive for its important historical heritage, including the Fountain of the Four Rivers or Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. This work by Gian Lorenzo Bernini is surprising for its sculptural ensemble, which represents the Nile, the River Plate, the Danube, and the Ganges. 8. Take a cruise on the Tiber River Taking a cruise on the Tiber River is one of the best ways to discover this ancient city. You'll enjoy a different view of the Eternal City and be able to see places of great historical importance such as the Castle of Sant'Angelo, an ancient fortress that served as a refuge for Pope Clement VII during the sieges that took place in 1527.

Rome belongs to the region of Lazio, which is one of the most prominent wine-producing regions in Italy.

Delve into Rome's Underbelly One of the most fascinating attractions in Rome in fact lies underneath the city. Rome's ancient catacombs are underground tunnels that served as a Christian and Jewish place of burial during approximately the 2nd-5th centuries AD. Incredibly, these passageways stretch for miles underneath the city's bustling streets. On this Underground Tour of Rome , you can delve into these ancient passages yourself and, accompanied by an expert guide, gain an insight into the lives, beliefs, and burial practices of Romans at the turn of the millennium.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/baths-caracalla,1,"Baths of Caracalla - Opening hours, tickets and location - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Baths of Caracalla Situated near the Appian Way, the Baths of Caracalla are one of the largest and most impressive thermae built in antiquity in Rome. Book your tour Built between the years 212 and 216 under the direction of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, more commonly known as Emperor Caracalla, the Baths of Caracalla were one of the greatest and most spectacular thermal complexes in ancient times. In spite of the fact that today only the brick walls and large collapsed vaults remain, the remnant of the splendour of the Baths of Caracalla is still preserved. The splendour of the baths Going to the baths was a favourite pastime of the Romans, who visited them regularly both to maintain their hygiene and to improve their social relations. In the vast precinct that held the baths, the citizens could not only use the public baths but also dedicate their time to doing exercise, visiting the library, walking through the gardens or worshipping the god Mithras and other pagan divinities by visiting the temple. The baths make up an architectural wonder when you keep in mind the date of their construction since they include effective water supply systems, as well as heating and drainage systems. The wood-fired ovens that were fed by the slaves served to heat the floors and walls of the baths, in addition to the water. Covered with marble and decorated with valued works of art, the Baths of Caracalla were the most sumptuous baths to be built in ancient times. Although subsequently they were surpassed in size by the Baths of Diocletian , these were not capable of matching their splendour. After remaining in operation for more than three hundred years, the baths were closed by necessity in the year 537, when the aqueducts that supplied water to the city were destroyed by the barbarians. The sculptures and valuable materials that decorated the baths were plundered and subsequently, in the year 847, an earthquake shook the building and destroyed part of it. The baths today In spite of the passing of centuries and of the lootings that the baths suffered, the ground floor of the buildings and a large part of the impressive walls that formed the precinct remain. By using your imagination it is possible to submerge yourself in the splendour of ages past.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/santa-maria-della-vittoria,1,"Santa Maria della Vittoria - Church in the novel Angels & Demons Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria della Vittoria Santa Maria della Vittoria, Our Lady of Victory in English, is a basilica dating from the 17th century . It was built to commemorate Emperor Ferdinand II's victory at the Battle of White Mountain. The basilica has become extremely popular since it appeared in the novel Angels & Demons , written by the American author Dan Brown. In its interior Although the church's façade isn’t very impressive, its interior is extravagantly decorated. Since there is very little natural light inside the church, it is filled with candles, which create a very special atmosphere . One of the most notable parts of the church is the Cornaro Chapel , which houses the “ Ecstasy of Saint Teresa ”, a sculpture by Bernini. This figure is considered to be a sculptural masterpiece of the Baroque period. The interior of Santa Maria della Vittoria suffered a fire in 1833 and had to be restored. However, nowadays, it's completely reconstructed. The Fountain of Moses Near the Basilica Santa Maria della Vittoria stands the grandiose Fontana dell’Acqua Felice, in English the Fountain of Moses. It was designed to symbolise the end of the Acqua Felice aqueduct. Although this fountain is not very popular among the Romans on account of its disproportion and its sheer size, it's an imposing architectural ensemble worth taking a look at . Impossible to Visit all the Churches in Rome Because of the vast number of churches in Rome, it's impossible to visit them all. Although Santa Maria della Vittoria is beautifully decorated, we would only recommend going to this basilica if you’re in Rome for a long holiday.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/pompeii,1,"Pompeii - Review, opening hours & how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Pompeii Pompeii was an ancient Roman city near modern Naples that was buried by the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Book a Day Trip Pompeii was the ancient city of Rome that was totally destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD. Since it was engulfed so quickly by a wall of volcanic mud, the city is extremely well preserved. Pompeii still has most of its buildings, streets, and even the volcano’s victims who died instantly and are preserved in ash. The Tragic Story of Pompeii The city is believed to have been founded by the Osci or the Oscans during the seventh century BC. Over the years the city prospered and grew with villas, monuments, and gardens. Pompeii was thriving when in 62 AD it was hit by a severe earthquake, damaging the city. While the city’s inhabitants were still reconstructing the city after the earthquake, as it's believed that almost all the buildings had been affected, in 79 AD a tragic event that would annihilate the town completely took place. On 24 August, Mount Vesuvius erupted covering Pompeii in ash. On the following morning, a river of volcanic mud enveloped the city. The remains lay forgotten until they were rediscovered in the sixteenth century. Excavations of Pompeii began in 1748 and over 45 hectares have since been unearthed. What to see Pompeii is very large, and tourists can visit numerous buildings in which residents went about their everyday lives, including some temples, the basilica, the forum, and baths, as well as some of the most lavish homes decorated with frescoes and mosaics. One of the most unusual buildings is the Lupanar, a brothel containing rudimentary stone beds as well as frescoes with erotic images. Many of the archaeological remains, including many of the bodies buried under layers of ash, are preserved in the Horrea and Olitorium. Visitors will be able to see how the citizens would cross the roads using enormous stone crosswalks so that they wouldn’t get muddy. Heart-stirring Pompeii was a fascinating city and it's surprising to find it so well preserved. The town seems to still be inhabited since most of the buildings are just as they were when the volcano erupted. Even the paintings, frescoes, and other decorative elements of the houses are intact. Probably one of the most hair-raising parts of the visit is the display of the victims of the explosion, which depicts the terror they felt seconds before dying. Getting to Pompeii The three main ways to get to Pompeii from Rome are: Booking a guided tour : This is the easiest way of getting to Pompeii. It includes a hotel pickup, transport there and back, a guided tour in English, admission tickets, and food. Train : To get to Pompeii by train visitors will have to take a train from Termini station to Naples, and once there, take the Circumvesuviana line to Pompei i . It can take between 2 and 3 hours to get there. The price can vary from € 30 and € 100 for a return trip, depending on the train you choose to take. Car rental : This is the cheapest option if you’re traveling with friends or family. However, keep in mind the price of the tolls, petrol and the time it takes to hire a car. We recommend this option to those who want to rent a car to visit other nearby cities .

Rome,https://www.rome.net/romulus-and-remus,1,"Romulus and Remus - The founding of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Romulus and Remus There are several fascinating legends and myths about how the city of Rome was founded, all collected by the Italian historian, Tito Livio . The Legend of Romulus and Remus Legend has it that Ascanio, son of the Trojan hero Aeneas (son of Venus and Anchises), founded the city of Alba Longa on the right bank of the river Tiber. Many of Aeneas' descendants reigned this settlement peacefully. When Nimitor was king, his brother Amulius seized power and dethroned Nimitor, killing his male heirs and forcing his daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin so that she would not provide a male heir to the throne. Nevertheless, Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins, Romulus and Remus, whose father was thought to be Mars, the god of War. Amulius imprisoned the daughter and condemned the babies to death by drowning in the river Tiber. However, the servant in charge of the task took pity on them and instead placed the twins into a basket and pushed them down the River Tiber. They were safely carried to the area of the seven hills. There, the boys were found by a she-wolf called Lupa who nursed them in her lair in Palatine Hill until they were found by a shepherd and his wife, who raised them as shepherds. As adults, Romulus and Remus were two natural-born leaders and in a fight killed King Amulius and reinstated Nimitor as king of Alba Longa. Seeking to establish their own settlement, Romulus finally built a wall around Palatine Hill, the location he had chosen for the founding of Rome. The she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus is said to have been their human foster mother . The term wolf, in Latin lupa, was also used, in a derogatory sense, for the prostitutes of the time. When seeking the perfect location for their new city, the twins wandered across the seven hills (Aventine, Celio, Capitol, Esquiline, Palatine , Quirinal and Viminal). Remus wished to start the city on Aventine Hill, while Romulus preferred Palatine Hill . In order to decide which brother was right they agreed to consult augury, where birds are examined to see what the gods favoured. Remus claimed to have seen six birds, whereas his brother had seen twelve. Even though Romulus had seen more birds, Remus argued that he had seen them first and therefore the city should be built on the Aventine Hill. Meanwhile, Romulus began to build a wall on his hill, which Remus decided to jump over. Angered by his brother’s action, Romulus killed him . According to the legend, this took place in 754 BC. The Legend of Aeneas According to another legend, the Trojan prince, Aeneas, reached the Italian coast and married Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus, thus becoming king . This myth is not only told by Greek historians, but is defended in Italy compared to other legends that give Rome an Arcadian origin, related to the myth of Evandro, or Achaean, related to Odysseus or Ulysses. The myth of Aeneas gives Rome a divine and Greek founding . However, the tradition of a Trojan origin of Rome cannot be considered admissible if you compare the date of the destruction of Troy (1200 BC) with the archaeological remains of the settlement of Latium and Septimontium, similar to many other Late Bronze Age settlements in Italy and far from being a major settlement, let alone a city.

Rome,https://www.rome.net/santa-maria-in-aracoeli,1,"Santa Maria in Aracoeli - Santo Bambino of Aracoeli Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria in Aracoeli The Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli is found very close to the Altare della Patria and is one of the most cherished churches by Rome’s inhabitants. The temple is famous since it houses the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden figure of the Child Jesus, which is said to be miraculous. History Located south of the Capitoline Hill, Santa Maria in Aracoeli was built during the sixth century on the site of an ancient Byzantine abbey. During the ninth century the church was given to the Benedictines, and a few centuries later, was given to the Franciscans. These restored the church giving it a more Gothic aspect. In 1797, during the Republic, the church was deconsecrated and transformed into a stable. Nowadays, the basilica has been fully reconstructed and is one of the most visited in Rome. The interior Millions of tourists and locals visit the church to see the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden image of the Christ Child, who is believed to resurrect the dead. The statue, made out of olive wood during the fifteenth century, was stolen in 1994 and was never recovered. A replica was made to substitute it. The temple has 22 columns, none exactly alike, which were taken from Roman ruins. It is also worth seeing various burials and frescoes from the fifteenth century. The wooden ceiling is decorated with paintings representing the Battle of Lepanto, where the Holy League defeated the fleet of the Ottoman Empire. Aracoeli staircase The Aracoeli staircase was completed in 1348 to celebrate the end of the Black Death in Rome. It is a marble staircase made up of 124 steep steps that finish at the entrance of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. It is believed that all those who climb the stairs on their knees will win the lottery. In the heart of the city The Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli is extremely well located, in the heart of the city, near the Altare della Patria . Therefore, stopping for a quick visit is very popular among visitors.

You’ll spot haringhandels (herring carts) serving up this Dutch speciality all over the city - ask for a broodje haring to get the fish served in a small sandwich with pickles and onions. The best time to try raw herring is between May and July, when it is said to be at its sweetest.

See if you can taste your way through all of these traditional Dutch snacks during your visit. Eat your way around food stalls in a former tram depot Image from Bowie Verschuuren Located in the hip Oud-West neighbourhood, De Hallen is a hotspot for arts, crafts, fashion and food in a recently refurbished industrial building dating from 1902.

Every other weekend, a fortnightly local goods market sets up stalls in the building’s main passageway. Wake up and smell the tulips Image from Tom Elst Yes, they’re as clichéd as clogs, but tulips are a definitive symbol of Dutch culture, and a trip to the Netherlands wouldn’t be complete without feasting your eyes on these beautiful blooms. If you’re visiting Amsterdam in spring, then take the short 20-minute trip out to the world-famous tulip fields ( Bollenstreek ) – stretching out in colourful stripes across miles of lowland fields between Haarlem and Leiden. There are also ample opportunities to stop and smell the tulips right in the heart of the city; the bulbs spill out of bouquets at the Bloemenmarkt, line the windows of the Tulip Museum (included in the City Card ) and seem to burst forth from every possible planter during the Tulip Festival, which lasts all of April.

Sex and drugs in Amsterdam: what are the rules? Updated 27 February 2025 at 13:34 Read Amsterdam’s rules around sex and drugs to ensure a safe and respectful visit. From cannabis policies and coffeeshop etiquette to laws on hard drugs, alcohol, and public behaviour, this guide covers everything you need to know. Learn about the Red Light District, tips for staying safe, and navigating Amsterdam’s unique culture while abiding by local laws. Cannabis Image from Koen Smilde Regarding soft drugs such as cannabis, a tolerance policy (""gedoogbeleid"") is applied in the Netherlands. This policy means that although the possession and buying of soft drugs are recognised as a violation of the law, you will not be prosecuted if it concerns a maximum amount of five grams of cannabis. Please note: From 2023, it's illegal for both visitors and Amsterdam residents to use soft drugs in the old city centre (Red Light District, Nieuwmarkt and Dam Square). These areas are marked with signs saying ‘No smoking cannabis in public’. Officers and enforcers can issue possible fines of €100. Amsterdam coffeeshops Tourists are allowed to buy cannabis in coffeeshops in Amsterdam. To enter, you must be 18 – your ID will be checked. Only purchase from reputable coffeeshops (never from street dealers) and start with a small amount if you are not experienced with cannabis. Never mix soft drug use with alcohol. Visitors should keep in mind that most venues other than coffeeshops do not allow soft drugs to be consumed on their premises. In other words, you can't smoke cannabis in most clubs or bars, even in smoking areas. Despite the accessibility of weed in Amsterdam, not everyone is a smoker. Always consider the people around you. Alcohol Image from Café Maxwell The consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the majority of public places (especially in the city centre), but you are naturally welcome to visit one of Amsterdam’s many bars. Never combine drugs with alcohol. Public nuisance Remember that Amsterdammers live in every neighbourhood, including the Red Light District, Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein. Limit noise and drunkenness, clean up your trash and don't pee in the canals. Return plastic bottles and cans to supermarkets for a deposit. Please be aware of the local laws and the on-the-spot fines for unacceptable behaviour: €150 for noise pollution €150 for littering €150 for public urination €100 for public intoxication Hard drugs Image from Darryl Adelaar As in the rest of the world, the use and distribution of hard drugs like cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy in Amsterdam is strictly illegal. Possession, dealing, selling, production and most other acts involving any drug is punishable by law. Bringing drugs into a club, bar or festival is prohibited. Visitors are strongly advised to prioritize their well-being. If you do choose to use drugs, be aware of the risks. Avoid street dealers Visitors are strongly advised to ignore street dealers, who often sell fake or unsafe drugs. Street dealers may attempt to sell dangerous substances to unsuspecting tourists in popular areas. It is crucial for visitors to understand that buying or using hard drugs not only exposes them to severe legal consequences but also poses significant risks to their health and safety. The quality and purity of substances purchased from street dealers are highly questionable, posing serious health risks such as overdoses, poisoning, or adverse reactions. Medical assistance after drug and alcohol use For severe drug-related emergencies, seek immediate medical assistance . If someone is not feeling well, don't hesitate to ask for help or call medical services at 112. In the Netherlands, you cannot be prosecuted for offences related to taking drugs after visiting the emergency department. Jellinek is a leading addiction prevention and treatment centre in the Netherlands. They specialise in providing evidence-based care for a wide range of addictions, including alcohol, drugs, and gambling. Read their advice online for visitors to Amsterdam. Sex workers and the Red Light District Image from Ferenc Horvath Window brothels, sex clubs and escort agencies can operate legally if the City of Amsterdam has granted them the relevant permits. Everyone is welcome to visit the Red Light District, although if touring the area, be respectful and don’t take photographs or record videos. If you decide to visit a sex worker, practise safe sex and never deal with sex workers under 21 years of age. Forced sex work is an extremely serious crime. Remain vigilant to indications of forced sex work (such as anxiety, bruises or willingness to have intercourse without a condom) and report any suspicions to the police by calling 0900-8844 /+31 343 578 844 or anonymously on 0800-7000 (from a Dutch phone). Official guided tours of the Red Light District are not allowed. During weekends, bars and other catering establishments in the Red Light District must close at 2:00. Access to these entertainment venues is only possible one hour before closing time. The cobbled streets of the Red Light District (De Wallen) are packed with quirky shops, museums, lively pubs and fantastic restaurants. Read on for more things to do in the Red Light District .

A special relationship developed between Van Gogh and the postman Joseph Roulin, his wife Augustine and their three children in Arles, in the South of France, which would lead to one of the most impressive portrait series in art history. Van Gogh and the postman Joseph Roulin. Finally together again Dates Fri 26 Dec 09:00 - 18:00 Sat 27 Dec 09:00 - 18:00 Sun 28 Dec 09:00 - 18:00 More dates Location Van Gogh Museum , Museumplein 6 , 1071 DJ Amsterdam Show in Google Maps Postman Joseph Roulin and his wife Augustine A large number of portraits from this unique series, which are now in museums and private collections around the world, are being reunited for the first time this autumn in the exhibition Van Gogh and the Roulins. Together Again at Last . This exhibition was realised in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which is home to two key works from the series: Joseph Roulin and La Berceuse . Other loans from the series are from museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Kröller-Müller Museum , the Stedelijk Museum , Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and Museum Folkwang in Essen. Featuring more than twenty loans from prominent international collections, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity to see this series of iconic portraits together. A special friendship When Van Gogh arrived in Arles in 1888, he had difficulty finding common ground with the local residents, but he found a kindred spirit in Joseph Roulin. The postman, with his striking beard and blue uniform, became a favourite model and Van Gogh’s best friend in the southern French town. Van Gogh painted not only Joseph, but also his wife Augustine and their three children: the seventeen-year-old Armand, the eleven-year-old Camille, and baby Marcelle. When Van Gogh suffered a severe mental crisis at the end of 1888, Joseph Roulin offered Vincent his unwavering support. He visited the artist at the hospital every day, and faithfully kept Vincent’s brother Theo updated in a series of letters, which are now being exhibited together for the first time. Together with the portraits, these letters offer a unique reflection on this remarkable friendship. The modern portrait The portraits that Van Gogh made of the family reflect his deepest artistic ambitions. He wanted to capture more than just a physical likeness. Following the artistic example of his predecessors Rembrandt and Frans Hals, he tried to penetrate the soul of his models – an ambition that coincided with his personal search for connection in a period of increasing loneliness and mental health problems. Context The exhibition places the Roulin portraits in a broader art historical context by also showing work by Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Adriaen van Ostade – artists who Vincent meticulously studied. Work by Paul Gauguin is also on display. During his time at the Yellow House in Arles, the French artist also portrayed several members of the Roulin family. The photographs of the Roulin family members taken between 1902 and 1955 are a remarkable inclusion in the exhibition, revealing how Joseph, Augustine, Armand, Camille and Marcelle Roulin looked in later life. On the second floor of the exhibition, visitors head through a life-sized replica of the Yellow House to enter Van Gogh’s studio, where he painted the Roulins. Old photographs of Arles complete the experience. The exhibition will first be on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (30 March to 7 September 2025) before travelling to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026).

From 15 October 2025 up to and including 25 January 2026, 'Michelangelo and Men' is on display: an exhibition about the fascination of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) with the male body. An international first: never before has an exhibition been entirely dedicated to this theme. More than twenty drawings from the collection of Teylers Museum will be supplemented with top-class international loans, including the marble sculpture 'Apollo-David'. All these works combined shed new light on the glorious leading role the male body played in both the life and art of Michelangelo. Naked and muscular Michelangelo was fascinated by the male body. Featuring in nearly all his artworks, he often portrayed it naked, muscular, and in provocative poses. His David and The Creation of Adam are artworks that are so deeply embedded in our collective memory that we often take them for granted. In Michelangelo's own time, however, these works were revolutionary, and over the course of history they were frequently considered controversial. Multiple perspectives Michelangelo and Men examines the male body in Michelangelo’s work and life from all angles: from the outside influences of his predecessors and classical antiquity, to his own extensive anatomic knowledge and use of male models. Also highlighted is the theoretical and religious significance of the male body to Michelangelo, as well as his presumed personal predilection for men. In the exhibition a number of contemporary voices furthermore reflect on how Michelangelo represented the male figure: from queer to Roman Catholic, and from feminist to personal trainer. In this way the exhibition also addresses timeless themes like gender, sexuality, and beauty ideals.

Life is messy and hard, but it makes us stronger. Andrés Reisinger Andrés Reisinger is one of the most sought-after visual artists and designers of the 21st century. He has carved out a unique position in contemporary culture by occupying and defining the fertile space between the digital and physical worlds. Originally from Argentina and currently residing in Spain where his studios are based, Reisinger bridges worlds with an instantly recognisable aesthetic that conveys a mesmerisingly clear vision. With his latest installation, visual artist and designer Andrés Reisinger transforms the Moco Museum Amsterdam into a mesmerising interactive environment where materiality and immateriality, reality and imagination, the organic, and the constructed seamlessly merge.

Explore the spacious streets for trendy bars, rooftop views, diverse stores, buzzing street markets and a totally different perspective on Amsterdam. Explore a 17th-century estate Image from Jan de Ridder Situated in the stunning Park Frankendael , Amsterdam's only surviving 17th-century country estate transports you back to an era of 17th-century grandeur. Wander through Huize Frankendael 's sprawling gardens, filled with manicured hedges, sculptures and water features. The stately home hosts exhibitions and special events throughout the year, and Restaurant Merkelbach , located in the former coach house, is an ideal spot for lunch. Check out the local brewing scene Image from amsterdam&partners With breweries around every corner and under every windmill, Amsterdam Oost is something of a Walhalla for craft beer lovers. Let's take Brouwerij ’t IJ to start with, which was an independent local microbrewery long before anyone dreamed up the modern terminology. Housed in a former bathhouse next to a proper Dutch windmill, the bar boasts a large enclosed terrace that stays busy in all weathers. Next up, the tasting room at Poesiat & Kater offers speciality brews with a side of history, including the resurrected legendary Van Vollenhoven beer. Or, for some fragrant grapefruit and lychee undertones to your beverage, sample classic concoctions from the heated terrace of De Eeuwige Jeugd . Sip jenever surrounded by gorgeous views Image from Koen Smilde Photography Image from Albert Brunsting Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 Located in a former pumping station, the tranquil terrace of Distillery ‘t Nieuwe Diep is almost entirely surrounded by water. Soak up the beautiful views over the lake as you sip on the best jenevers and liqueurs from the tasting room. This hidden hotspot is parked right in the middle of Flevopark , a tranquil escape packed with walking routes and gorgeous green barbecue areas. It’s also where you’ll find the Joodse Begraafplaats Zeeburg, a Jewish cemetery that is now heritage-listed. Take a walk at Oosterpark Image from Jan de Ridder Oosterpark is a fantastic green space filled with ponds, streams, a wading pool for children and plenty of walking paths. In the summer months, the lawns will be awash with sunbathers and picnickers from diverse walks of life and the park also hosts a variety of festivals. Sit back overlooking the pond to try and catch a glimpse of the park’s nesting birds or pass by the Speaker’s Stone on a Sunday afternoon to hear the locals saying what’s on their mind. Play boules in a hidden garden Image from TK Photography Amsterdam Oost is awash with fantastic bar terraces for people-watching, but only one has a secret jeu-de-boules pitch. De Vergulden Eenhoorn (The Gilded Unicorn) is a historic pub and farm founded in 1702, serving up tasty seasonal lunch and dinner dishes such as Moroccan Taktouka with asparagus, egg and chorizo or Indonesian gado-gado salad with sesame chicken and cashew nuts. In the back. After a stand-out meal, you can take to the hidden picnic garden and book one of the boules lanes - the perfect way to while away some merry hours on a summer evening. Eat and haggle at a street market Image from Koen Smilde If you’re a fan of street markets , you’re in the correct city (and a great neighbourhood). The Dappermarkt on Dapperstraat is a great place to pick up everything from fresh produce to beautiful fabric. You’ll also often find good meat or cheese and the occasional sushi wrap. As with all street markets, the goods on offer and crowd sizes vary significantly daily; the best way to find out is to head there. Some fish vendors here are an excellent opportunity to sample traditional Dutch delicacies like kibbeling , herring or eel. Check out a festival Image from Jan de Ridder Oosterpark is home to a busy schedule of events, and some great festivals. The Keti Koti Festival (Surinamese for broken chains) celebrates the abolition of slavery with a busy, colourful festival complete with performers and a parade. The Amsterdam Roots Festival is filled with song, dance, acrobatics and kid’s activities. Expect to find some fantastic food and shopping stalls throughout both. And there’s a lot more throughout the year, so keep an eye on the park’s Facebook page for the latest. Discover the up-and-coming food scene Image from Bar Botanique Oost is a beautifully diverse neighbourhood, and a trip there wouldn’t be complete without a meal at one of the many local favourites. The green Bar Botanique on Swindenstraat is here for you if you’re in a French-Mediterranean mood. Finally, for all-day dining and bar food, try turbo or De Tros , or Badhuis on the Javaplein. Check out our dedicated restaurant and bar guide for more foodie tips. Catch an art-house film, or ten Image from Studio/K Films large and small find their way onto the Studio/K schedule, a homey arthouse cinema, café and club on Timorplein. Some 50 dedicated students painstakingly put the schedules together, so expect the best in classics and new releases whenever you visit. If you’re in the city in August, you’ll not want to miss one of the indoor or open-air shows either. Festival screenings will be held at different times and across the city, so the website is your best bet for staying current. Here's our culture guide for more hotspots in Oost. Shop and eat your way along Javastraat Image from Koen Smilde Gentrification has well and truly set in, yet this street named after one of the Netherlands’ former spice islands remains a compelling melting pot, where Moroccan butchers and Surinamese roti shops sit next to trendy concept stores, stylish (coffee) boutiques and edgy streetwear specialists. Highlights include plant paradise De Balkonie , Middle Eastern deli Tigris & Eufraat , streetwear store DIV.Amsterdam and cake shop Majesteit Taart . It’s also a buzzing dining and drinking destination, so there are plenty of places to rest and refuel. Don’t miss the recently re-opened bar-restaurant Badhuis , in the former neighbourhood bath house on Javaplein. Or head to the beloved locavore specialist Wilde Zwijnen , charming Italian wine bar Gallizia or modern bistro Le French Café .

The exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum pays tribute to a versatile and profound artist. Visitors will see not only his well-known photographs and series, but also lesser-known work. Videos, sculptures, advertising material, and pieces from his personal archive are on display. The exhibition concludes with his final, unfinished video work. Erwin Olaf – Freedom Dates Fri 26 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 Sat 27 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 Sun 28 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 More dates Location Stedelijk Museum - Museum of Modern Art , Museumplein 10 , 1071 DJ Amsterdam Show in Google Maps A journey through his career It begins with his black-and-white photos from the early 1980s. He took these photos spontaneously on the streets, such as at gay rights demonstrations. They already reveal his commitment to society. Erwin Olaf loved light and beautiful composition. He wanted more control over his photographs and therefore began working in the studio. The exhibition features many of these studio photographs, both well-known and lesser-known. They come from series such as Ladies Hats (1985-2022), Chessmen (1987-88), Royal Blood (2000), Grief (2007), Fashion Victims (2000), Berlin (2012), and Skin Deep (2015). His commissions are also on display, such as SM in Holland (1989) and photographs he made for the Netherlands Dance Theatre and the National Ballet. Freethinker Erwin Olaf Springveld (1959–2023) was a renowned Dutch photographer and artist. He was internationally acclaimed for his unique working method: his photographs were carefully composed, with striking lighting and a keen eye for detail. Olaf was a freethinker. Personal freedom was always central to him. In his work, he demonstrated the importance of being yourself. He created art that explored topics such as identity, sexuality, gender, the human body, nightlife, and equal rights for everyone. His critical and proactive attitude toward society is a key theme in his work. This is clearly reflected in the exhibition about his life and art. It is structured around various themes, but also shows how his work has evolved over the years.

It's the most frequently asked question at the museum. And now it's finally here. In the colorful exhibition ""At Home in the 17th Century,"" you'll experience daily life 400 years ago up close. Full of surprising stories and unique objects. As a visitor, you'll walk through a full day in the 17th century via nine life-size viewing boxes.

People lived in homes as diverse as their lives. Through everyday experiences, you'll discover all facets of society at the time. So much to discover Earthenware cooking pots and brooms are juxtaposed with the mantelpiece Philip Vingboons designed for Amsterdam mayor Joan Huydecoper and a unique silk bodice, a masterpiece from the V&A Museum in London. The exhibition centers on the famous dollhouses of Petronella Oortman and Petronella Dunois, highlights of the Rijksmuseum's collection. From rage ball to silver From early morning to late evening. You'll experience a day in a 17th-century household. You'll wander through rooms filled with objects, from mopheads to silverware, and discover that every object tells something about who the people were and how they lived. They, too, struggled with balancing work and family, had sex, and mourned family. On the other hand, they often made very different choices than we do today. Think of health, interior design, or the division of labor at home. You'll realize how close and yet so far away the 17th century is. The cardboard world of Steef de Jong Theatre maker and visual artist Steef de Jong is the exhibition's designer and, just like in his performances, uses cardboard as his primary material. He has created nine viewing boxes that transport you to various domestic activities at different times of the day. Dollhouse by Petronella Oortman The centerpiece of the exhibition is the dollhouse of Petronella Oortman, a very wealthy woman. The dollhouse is one of the Rijksmuseum's most prized pieces and has been fully digitized for the first time. An online special, to be released in October, will allow you to wander through the miniature rooms of the dollhouse.

The Dylan | Keizersgracht 384, Nine Streets, Centrum W Amsterdam Image from W Hotel With its perfect mixture of innovative design and breathtaking heritage architecture , it's funny to think that the W Amsterdam comprises two formerly incredibly boring buildings: a telephone exchange and a bank.

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/explore/neighbourhoods/oost/a-night-out-in-oost,1,"A night out in Amsterdam-Oost Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam Explore Amsterdam Neighbourhoods of Amsterdam Oost A night out in: Oost Image from Charlotte van de Gaag A night out in: Oost Updated 10 September 2025 at 12:23 Written by Tom Flanagan Oost might be known for the hustle and bustle of its daytime markets, but a trip out after-hours proves that nighttimes are just as buzzing in the east. This easy itinerary is a worthwhile plan for when you end up in this part of town after dark. Culture World-class curation at Framer Framed Image from Framer Framed / Eva Broekema Curators and artists collide at this long-standing project space and arts foundation in the cultural epicentre of Amsterdam Oost. Every year, the venue collaborates with emerging and established international talents to organise exhibitions and an extensive public programme of lectures, debates, screenings and performances. You'll be confronted with work at the cutting edge of contemporary art, visual culture and politics from a diverse range of voices and perspectives in society. Pre-drinks Beers and sunshine at De Groene Olifant / Brouwerij ‘t IJ Image from Sophie Image from Koen Smilde Photography Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 On the corner of Plantagebuurt and Oost, you’ll find De Groene Olifant , a cosy local pub nestled between the zoo and leafy Plantage streets. With its living-room style décor, board games and laid-back crowd, it’s a favourite neighbourhood hangout where you can stop for a coffee, craft beer, or a homemade snack. On sunny evenings, the terrace is a gem – perfect for watching the world go by before you begin your night. Plus, it’s not far from Brouwerij ‘t IJ, if you want more beers (and snacks) before a proper meal. Food Communal eats at Dapper Café / Eatmosfera Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 Your next stop is food and you have tons of options, though there are a few notable crowd-pleasers for a group. First up is Dapper Café, located just around the corner from De Groene Olifant and Brouwerij ‘t IJ. The newest venture on the Dappermarkt, this is a queer-run venue with a vegetarian-focused menu, home to the city’s crispiest potatoes. Perhaps the biggest pull, however, is its location, with a terrace that catches the sun almost all day long, making it an ideal spot to transition from dinner into cocktails. Alternatively, head to arguably the city’s best pizzeria at Eatmosfera, where you’ll be wined and dined with oaky Tuscan whites and an excellent Stracciatella pizza. Cocktails Views and global flavours at Canvas / Catua Bar Image from Volkshotel Head to the roof of the Volkshotel for some of the city’s most sumptuous views and cocktails at Canvas . The enclosed rooftop terrace is on the seventh floor and has a fantastic all-around view of the Amstel and the city centre. Hungry folks should head there during the weekdays for lunch, dinner, and bites. For something more lowkey, Catua Bar is just around the corner; a place for cocktails from Brazil to South Africa, though classics like the house-batch Negroni never go amiss. Music Balkan sounds at Kalemegdan Most people look for rock and jazz when it comes to live music, but Kalemegdan provides something different. A Balkan music bar, you’ll be blessed with the many genres of this southeastern European area and beyond, from Yugoslavian rock and pop to Argentinian jazz. Dig into ćevapčići (grilled sausages considered to be Bosnia and Herzegovina’s national dish) while the sounds of the Balkans swell around you – there’s no place quite like it. Clubbing Bunker atmosphere at Levenslang / Doka Image from Charlotte van de Gaag Image from Volkshotel Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 If you’ve ever wondered what partying in a prison is like, head to Levenslang and you’ll find out. Housed in the boiler room of former Bijlmerbajes prison at the southernmost edge of Oost,  this concrete corner is a fully fledged techno paradise, with all-nighters hosting some of the biggest local and international DJs around. Otherwise, for a convenient option after cocktails at Canvas, Doka is a subterranean listening bar in the basement of Volkshotel with an exceptional audio setup and such good sound insulation you’d never know it was there. Late-night food Herby kebabs at Tarbush There aren’t a ton of late-night eats this side of town, but Tarbush is a trusted stop for those looking for a midnight kebab. You’ll find it on one of Ooost’s major arteries – the Javastraat – where lemon and herby chicken and kebab meats are stuffed into foot-long dürüms, a perfect antidote for a long and hopefully successful night out in Oost.

Image from Pavlovs Safety, health and crime in Amsterdam: who do I contact? Updated 16 October 2025 at 16:14 Planning a trip to Amsterdam? Knowing who to contact in emergencies is essential for a safe and worry-free visit. This guide covers health services, emergency contacts, police support, and safety tips for navigating the city, from medical care to handling lost belongings. Stay prepared and enjoy Amsterdam with peace of mind. Keep these crucial numbers handy for any situation. Safety disclaimer and advice during Amsterdam Dance Event Image from mikebreeuwer.com We want you to have a fantastic time at ADE — but safety first. Know that the (mis)use of drugs is illegal, and there are real health risks involved. Stay hydrated, eat well, and avoid mixing substances. Through ADE's “ Celebrate Safe ” campaign, venues will have enhanced security, medical aid stations, and staff on hand to provide assistance. For your journey home (or between events), services like Diva Ride (female-driver option) are available to offer an inclusive ride. Take care of yourself and those around you. If anything feels wrong, physically or in your surroundings, don’t wait: get help immediately. Know your limits and respect those of others. Medical assistance Image from Shuttershock Emergencies (112) In life-threatening situations, call the emergency helpline by dialling 112. An ambulance, fire department or police will be dispatched to help you. This is a Europe-wide emergency helpline (equivalent to 911 in the United States or 999 in the United Kingdom). In addition to Dutch, operators speak English and can offer services in French or German. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you can send an equivalent text to 0800 8112. For emergency visits to your hotel room, telephone consultations and consultations on location, contact the hotel reception or call the tourist doctor at +31 (0)20 427 5011. Fees are determined by the National GP Association and are covered by most travel and medical insurance. Hospitals and ER The accident and emergency ( spoedeisende hulp or more commonly A&E) department of a hospital is meant for life-threatening situations requiring immediate specialist medical treatment. In all non-life-threatening situations, first, contact your GP. They will determine if you need treatment in A&E and inform you which hospital or location to visit. General health For less serious issues – such as minor falls, forgotten medication or unexpected/recurring minor conditions – you can contact TouristDoc on +31 202 624 282. TouristDoc's medical professionals provide comprehensive in-room medical care for Amsterdam's visitors who want to bypass the inconvenience of hospital visits. For information on fees, visit the website. Amsterdam's 24-hour dental clinic, Dental 365 , treats patients experiencing chronic pain and other dental emergencies on a walk-in basis. The practice is open from 8:00 until 23:00, and a dentist is on call 24/7 for emergencies after these hours. Police Image from Bas Uterwijk Reporting a crime If you have been a victim of harassment, intimidation, violence, robbery, or any other type of crime during your visit to Amsterdam, it is really important to report this. Either report the crime online or in person at a police station in the city (by appointment). The Dutch police website offers a search tool for police station locations. In emergency situations or to report a crime in progress, call 112. For non-emergency situations requiring police assistance or to make an appointment to report a crime in person, call 0900-8844 (if using a mobile phone with an international SIM card please dial +31 343 578 844). Hate crimes Amsterdam is for everybody, regardless of race, religion, gender identification, political beliefs or sexual preference. Visitors and residents are free to be who they want to be, and have their views and choices respected. Hate crimes against members of any community or minority will never, ever be tolerated. If you’re a member of the LGBTQI+ community, read this guide to safety and resources in Amsterdam for more advice. Lost and found If your passport has been stolen, report this to the police . If you have lost your keys, wallet or other personal possessions, or you have found somebody else's lost belongings, the iLost website should be your first stop. Remember that it usually takes three business days for an object to be registered online. Dropped something valuable in the canal? If your bike, valuables, keys, or phone fall into the canal, don't fear! Mark the location and call Recovery Divers , who will come to the rescue (for a fee) with their scuba diving gear, metal detectors, and pinpointers to fish it out. Usually, they can help you the same day or the next day, depending on availability and what kind of item you lost. They dive in water such as ponds, canals, rivers, and lakes throughout the Netherlands. Enforcement officials Municipal enforcement officials ( handhavers ) are a familiar sight in Amsterdam, particularly in busy public spaces, train stations, and public transport. Representing the City of Amsterdam, they ensure safety and security on the streets. Easily recognisable in blue uniforms with ""Handhaving"" on the back and a reflective chequered strip on the chest, they are approachable and ready to assist locals and tourists with directions or municipal queries. Their daily tasks include addressing car parking issues, illegal waste dumping, nuisance behaviour, and improper bike/scooter parking. They can request identification, issue fines or warnings for minor offences, and notify the police or other authorities in unsafe or illegal situations, allowing the police to focus on serious crimes. Pickpockets As in all major cities, pickpockets can be active in crowded places like cafés, bars, restaurants, and major events in Amsterdam. Keep a close eye on your belongings, especially valuables like smartphones. If possible, store them in a hotel safe or station locker and carry minimal cash. Report any pickpocketing to the police. Be cautious of distractions, such as someone pushing, touching, or asking for directions. Pickpockets often work in teams, using signals to coordinate. If a stranger engages you, it could be a distraction for theft. To prevent mobile phone theft, note your phone's IMEI number and report thefts immediately so the police can add it to a national stolen phone database. Install a 'find my phone' app to help trace its location. Traffic and road safety Image from Koen Smilde Photography Driving and sleeping in vehicles Amsterdam's narrow streets and canals are not ideal for cars, especially in busy districts with many pedestrians and cyclists. Use parking garages or park-and-ride facilities outside the city centre, which have excellent public transport links. Read this guide to driving in Amsterdam . Sleeping in vehicles is prohibited in Amsterdam for safety reasons, with fines of €140 for violations. Cycling and walking Amsterdam residents own about 850,000 bicycles and cycle two million kilometres daily. The city continues to improve bike paths and parking facilities to maintain its status as a bike-friendly city. Read our complete guide to safety and cycling in Amsterdam . In Amsterdam’s city centre, narrow streets and pavements often tempt pedestrians onto public roads, cycle lanes and tramways, but this is dangerous. Stay on pavements, give space to wheelchair users, and check for bikes and traffic before crossing streets. Remember, traffic in the Netherlands drives on the right. Check out our video about walking in Amsterdam . Be careful near the canals While picturesque, canals can be dangerous. Falling into the water is risky due to high walls and cold temperatures.

She’s since embedded herself into the pop-sphere, as much for her sound as her outward queer lyricism and appeal. Catch her at Melkweg as he debuts her latest album, a cathartic body of work that captures what it means to begin again. 16 December | doors open 19:00 | Melkweg | tickets here SOHN If you like: Jamie Woon, Låpsley The musical moniker of Christopher Michael Taylor, SOHN, mixes downtempo beats with soulful vocals that have earned him a reputation as a go-to for moody, ambient electronica. He’ll be bringing some winter cool to Bitterzoet’s stage, a perfect choice for those looking for a bit of introspection and songs that linger. 13 December | doors open 19:30 | Bitterzoet | tickets here Flyte If you like: Laura Marling, José González The indie folk project of English duo Will Taylor and Nick Hill, Flyte’s warm, guitar-led melodies have led them to the summit of folk and collaborations with some of the genre’s top artists, from The Staves to Laura Marling. Lush harmonies and introspective lyrics combine for what’s always an intimate gig. 11 December | doors open 19:30 | Melkweg Oz | tickets here Julia Wolf If you like: Halsey, kiiara Sexy, sultry pop with sucker punch production, Julia Wolf expertly blends side-eye lyricism with TikTok-ready sounds that look back to the grungy early 2000s. One for the pop heads that like a little sadness. 11 December | doors open 20:00 | Melkweg Up | tickets here Ball Park Music If you like: Vance Joy, Boy & Bear Brisbane-hailing five-piece Ball Park Music have been making music for years now, with eight albums of critically acclaimed indie pop under their belt. Their latest endeavour Like Love radiates much of the jangly and chipper guitar sound that’s earned them a dedicated fanbase, with ‘Please Don’t Move to Melbourne’ a lovely gateway song for new fans and old. Stop by Tolhuistuin and catch them in action – and bring your friends too. 6 December 2025 | doors open 18:30 | Tolhuistuin | tickets here Christmas Classics at the Movies For a full-blown classical Christmas, head to The Concertgebouw, where you’ll find the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie performing classic festive songs from films for an entire afternoon and evening. Expect songs by John Williams, Tchaikovsky and Danny Elfman alongside live renditions of seasonal favourites like White Christmas and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas in a showcase of musical excellence and classical comfort. 28 December 2025 | concert begins 20:15 | Het Concertgebouw | tickets here CLUBBING & FESTIVALS Emo Night If you like: Pop Punk, metal core, emo punk While December is all about looking ahead to the new year, Emo Night in Melkweg is a celebration of past subcultures and phases, bringing nostalgia to the current generations. Expect old hits and new bangers in a lineup carefully curated by the Emo DJ team.

This time, Poing does not disappoint, bringing a diverse lineup, consisting of local legends such as De Schuurman b2b Slimfit, as well as big international names such as Evissimax from Italy, fka PHAEDRA from Mexico City, and the headliner - DJ LIZZ, a Chilean-based headliner and producer, one of the leading figures of the neoperreo movement. 5 December 2025 | doors open 23:00 | Tilla Tec | tickets here Afro Fest If you like: afrobeats, hip-hop, R&B Indulge in the best Afrobeats, including dancehall, Amapiano, and Afrohouse, at Afro Fest, the largest Afro event in Amsterdam. The entire venue will come alive as all three halls of Paradiso will pulse with different rhythms from across the diaspora.

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/travel-stay/where-to-stay/cheap-but-trendy-hostels,1,"Cheap but trendy hostels in Amsterdam  | I amsterdam Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam Travel and stay Where to stay Cheap but trendy hostels in Amsterdam Image from All rights reserved Nikolas Koenig 2016 Cheap but trendy hostels in Amsterdam Updated 29 July 2025 at 14:04 Whether you’re staying for a day or a month, find cheap hostels and affordable hotels in Amsterdam that mix cool, contemporary design and historical charm. Generator Hostel Amsterdam Image from Generator Amsterdam One of the most popular upscale hostels in Amsterdam, Generator Amsterdam offers travellers luxury at a discount. The building, once part of a university zoological department, combines the historic and the modern with amenities like the Auditorium - a lecture-hall-turned-bar which has kept its auditorium seating and repurposed quirky items left over from its school days. The Nescio Café gets visitors’ creative juices flowing with its locally sourced menu and whimsical wall graphics created by local artists. You can bunk with fellow travellers in shared rooms or spend a bit more to nab a view of the nearby Oosterpark in the Sky Suite, located at the top of the hostel. Neighbourhood: Oost The Social Hub – West / Oost Image from Kasia Gatkowska Photography Lively, busy and aimed at millennials, The Social Hub offers the experience of student life for travellers. The minimalistic design carries throughout the rooms and the communal areas, even the complimentary gym. Students set up in the study and work areas, which are designed to minimise distraction but stimulate creative juices. The lounge and game areas are all about keeping the conversation going with bold colours and exciting décor. Rooms are available for students as well as hotel and long-term guests, so the crowd is always mixed. Neighbourhood: Nieuw-West / Oost ClinkCoco Image from Esthern Scherpenzeel If there were ever a place to be called a home away from home, it’s ClinkCoco . Designed to feel just like staying over at mom’s house — with plenty of strangers, of course— Cocomama bundles contemporary design with comfort in every nook and cranny. Each room has a traditional Dutch theme to evoke the history of the Netherlands in modern detail. Surround yourself with the art of Tulips, Delfts Blue and Van Gogh (though quirkier Cheese or KLM themes are available for particularly creative travellers) in private double rooms or dormitories. Neighbourhood: Centre / De Pijp ClinkNOORD Image from Esthern Scherpenzeel Located in Noord, ClinkNOORD occupies the space where a 1920s laboratory once stood. The rooms are sparse, but it’s in the communal areas that the artistic design comes through. Walk along the bright yellow staircase and path to the lounge area, decorated with a contrasting turquoise that stimulates the mind. The hostel has installed art features in and around the hostel to create conversations. A grand stained glass window looks over a staircase, while industrial knobs and pipes line a nearby wall. Outside, a picnic table painted in the style of Mondrian provides a place for likeminded creatives to eat and socialise. Neighbourhood: Noord Hotel Not Hotel Image from Hotel Not Hotel Every room at the Hotel Not Hotel is an adventure. Designed and created by a group of designers from the Eindhoven Design Academy, the rooms are unique not just in their interior, but their entrance, location and overall idea. Spend a night in a transformed tram cart in the middle of the busy communal space or hide behind a secret bookcase. Wherever you’re located in the hostel, all guests are invited to indulge at Kevin Bacon (the bar, not the actor). Some rooms, starting at €75 a night, are intended to provide as much interaction as possible with fellow travellers, while others let you maintain much-needed privacy. Neighbourhood: De Baarsjes Stayokay - Oost / Vondelpark Image from Taco van der Werf Stayokay Oost is in the characteristically lively district called the 'Indische Buurt', surrounded by trendy shops, hip restaurants, world-famous museums and lively markets. Within 15 minutes, you can reach the city centre by tram or bicycle. The Oost location has its own restaurant, The 5th, and guests don't even have to leave the building to enjoy a movie or theatrical performance. The Vondelpark location is just a stone’s throw from Amsterdam's shopping streets, museums and nightlife, and the atmosphere reflects the liveliness of the rest of the city. Neighbourhood: Centre / Oost Meininger - Amstel / West Image from Meiniger Hotel Image from Meiniger Hotel Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 It does not matter whether you're on a business trip, family holiday, class trip or going solo, Meininger Hotel Amsterdam Amstel ensures all guests will have a good time. The modern rooms, the friendly staff and the central location are the perfect ingredients for a relaxing stay in the capital. Those who want to escape the bustling city life can relax in the nearby Prince Bernhard Park and Park Frankendael. Or, head out to the West location, which is conveniently situated next to Sloterdijk Station. Meininger Amsterdam City West offers modern rooms with free Wi-Fi. The hotel’s facilities include a bar, a guest kitchen where you can prepare your own meal and a spacious lobby decorated with traditional Dutch art. Neighbourhood: Oost / West Volkshotel Image from Volkshotel Volkshotel , located in Amsterdam Oost, is truly for all people. Standard rooms range from the aptly named Miss Petite to the Mrs. Massive and everything in between. The rooms’ wood, glass and concrete décor acknowledges the building’s former history as a newspaper headquarters while keeping a streamlined, modern design. Those with a larger budget may try out one of the nine Special Rooms, each specifically designed with concepts such as a Japanese spa or a cabin in the woods. Wherever you want to go, you can find it at Volkshotel. On the roof, sweat out your troubles in the barrel-shaped sauna with a view of the city or party until sunrise in the basement bar, Doka, or the rooftop terrace, Canvas. Neighbourhood: Oost BUNK Image from Wouter van der Sar Image from Wouter van der Sar Image from Wouter van der Sar Image from Wouter van der Sar Previous slide Next slide 1 / 4 Slide 1 of 4 BUNK Amsterdam redefines affordable accommodation with style and creativity. Located in a converted church in Amsterdam Noord, it offers a mix of private pods and cosy rooms at budget-friendly prices.

Editor’s Pick: Hortus Winteravonden Image from Jan Jaap Hubeek Best for: plant lovers This winter, it’s time to get cosy at one of the world’s oldest botanical gardens, as the doors remain open until late for Hortus Winteravonden (Winter Evenings). Venture through the beautifully lit greenhouses – and the new Climate Greenhouse, which spans three climates around the world – as you discover ancient palms and tropical plants. Cuddle up by the campfire with a hot chocolate on the winter terrace and experience exclusive exhibitions featuring night-blooming flowers and much more. Hortus Winteravonden | 27-30 December & 2-3 January | Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam Light Festival Image from Janus van den Eijnden Best for: night owls The city’s annual light festival returns, this time under the theme of ‘Legacy’ and how we want to be remembered. To glimpse all the installations looking to capture what that means, you have a range of options. Opt for a cocktail cruise with one of the many canal companies or follow a self-guided 6.5km walking route that you can dip into at your own pace. Bring your winter coat, camera and a sense of awe. Amsterdam Light Festival | Until 18 January 2026 | city-wide The Nutcracker and the Mouse King at National Opera & Ballet Best for: festive nostalgia One of the season’s most celebrated shows returns to the National Opera & Ballet stage for a festive run. The Nutcracker and the Mouse King – a tale of an inanimate Nutcracker coming to life to fend off the evil Mouse King – takes ballet form this time as snow-flecked dancers in frosted attire glide across the winter stage. Choreographed and designed by Toer van Schayk, he was inspired by the drawings of artist Christiaan Andriessen (1777-1854), which provided a window into an Amsterdam of old. The Nutcracker and the Mouse King | 12 December 2025 – 2 January 2026 | National Opera & Ballet Derek Mitchell’s Double Dutch: Two at Meervaart Best for: searing cultural commentary Nobody gets the Dutch and the Americans (and even the Brits) better than Derek Mitchell. He’s best known for his live shows blending standup with cultural commentary, which are a tongue-in-cheek ode to his adopted homeland. Catch him at the Meervaart Theatre for his Double Dutch Two show, for searing comedy on what it means to be caught between cultures. Double Dutch | 8 December 2025 | Meervaart Theatre Surinamese Art in Transition at Museum Cobra Best for: inquisitive artists This past November marked 50 years of Surinamese independence. And Museum Cobra is commemorating that milestone with a special exhibition dedicated entirely to Surinamese Art. Around 24 artists and one collective will present their works on what Surinamese freedom means, depicting its past struggle, present change and future, with fashion, photography, paintings, installations, film, and performance art all on show. Wi Sranan. Surinamese Art in Transition | Until 1 March 2026 | Museum Cobra Winterparadijs at RAI Image from Het Amsterdamse Winterparadijs Best for: seasonal maximalism The RAI transforms into a winter wonderland in December with indoor and outdoor ice-skating rinks, parties in the Après-Ski Village, dining options galore and fairground rides overlooking the city. Tube across real (fake) snow, cross-country ski between the fir trees, roast marshmallows over a crackling fire, practice your curling skills or join in with a classic snowball fight. When it's all too much fun, head into the Winter Cinema for nostalgic festive classics. Winterparadijs | 17 December - 3 January | RAI World Christmas Circus at Carré Image from Koninklijk Theater Carré Best for: family outings For decades, the World Christmas Circus at Royal Theater Carré has been one of the most popular family outings during the festive period. Marvel at the flying trapeze artists, star clowns, enchanting costumes, horse whisperers, and daredevils as award-winning acts from the most prominent circus festivals worldwide join forces in one spectacular show for this 39th edition. World Christmas Circus | 17 December 2025 - 4 January 2026 | Carré Queer Christmas Market at Door Open Space Best for: non-traditionalists Christmas markets are everywhere in and around Amsterdam, but why not break with convention and tradition this year and head to the Queer Christmas Market? Meet 35+ queer entrepreneurs selling a range of vintage, art, food and drinks, with drag performances on show too. This is a chance to support queer makers, sort out your seasonal gifting and indulge in the festive spirit – plus the market donates €0.50 per ticket to a queer charity so there’s a good cause to support too. Queer Christmas Market | 13 December, 11:00-17:00 | Door Open Space Vivian Ammerlaan at Singer Laren Image from Vivian Ammerlaan Best for: intrepid travellers Get swept up in the dreamy, storm-coloured images of Vivian Ammerlaan whose photography of the Rocky Mountains is almost as good as visiting the region yourself. Inspired by her travels among the ridges, Amerlaan’s shots are haunting, spectral and effortlessly wintry. Bookend your trip with a visit to the on-site café for a cosy winter afternoon. Vivian Ammerlaan | until 18 January 2026 | Singer Laren Amsterdam, almost demolished at Grachtenmuseum Best for: urban history The Museum of Canals (Grachtenmuseum) is one of the city’s unsung heroes and its latest exhibition is proof of more quiet heroism. In Amsterdam, almost demolished, the tale of how the city maintained its historic architecture and centre in the face of a mass modernisation push takes centre stage. A tapestry of protest footage, maps and photography, the exhibition traces the people who helped preserve Amsterdam’s beauty – and it’s future.

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/explore/winter-in-amsterdam/reasons-to-visit-amsterdam-in-winter,1,"Reasons to visit Amsterdam in winter | I amsterdam Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam Explore Amsterdam Winter in Amsterdam Reasons to visit Amsterdam in winter Image from Thomas van Galen Reasons to visit Amsterdam in winter Updated 17 December 2025 at 20:48 For anyone planning a trip to Amsterdam, the colder months are a magical time to visit the Dutch capital when nights are cosy, food is hearty, and everything twinkles in fairy lights. Here are just a few reasons why Amsterdam is the perfect winter destination. Amsterdam looks like a fairy tale in the snow Image from Marie Charlotte Pezé There are no two ways about it; Amsterdam is stunning in white. Impossibly pretty at the worst of times, the city looks like a Christmas card when it’s dusted in snowflakes – making for a wildly romantic backdrop to any visit. For optimum snowman conditions, head to one of the larger parks like Vondelpark, Amsterdamse Bos or Westerpark, where you’ll find vast expanses of uninterrupted white stuff just waiting to be packed into snowballs. And don't miss the chance to head into the surrounding region for some the best winter day trips in the Amsterdam Area . The city becomes a spectacle of light Image from Koen Smilde Transforming Amsterdam into a vast outdoor art gallery during the darkest winter months, the annual Amsterdam Light Festival sees magical light installations adorn canals, streets and landmarks from December to January. And, of course, you can always rely on a grand department store to bring the festive atmosphere and theatrical window displays. De Bijenkorf on Dam Square hosts a special ceremony in mid-November every year to switch on the thousands of (energy-efficient) twinkling lights that decorate its building. Crowds gather to admire the spectacle, which includes performances, a fireworks display and a late-night shopping event. Here's a roundup of the best places to see the holiday lights . You can (sometimes) ice-skate on the frozen canals Image from Koen Smilde It doesn’t happen often, but if conditions are correct (and generally, the temperature needs to dip below four degrees for four consecutive nights), then canals are blocked off to allow enough ice to form. Et voila; the world’s most beautiful ice rink. But even if the canals don’t freeze over this year, there are plenty of other opportunities for outdoor ice skating in Amsterdam – including the spectacular Winterparadijs ice fair and the Jaap Eden ice rink. Everything is gezellig Image from Patrick Schneider Dark nights, twinkling fairy lights, playing board games in cosy pubs… everything about winter in Amsterdam is genuinely gezellig . Pronounced ‘he-zell-ick’,  this word with no literal English translation is at the heart of Dutch culture, encompassing everything from ‘cosy’ and ‘quaint’ to ‘friendly’ and ‘relaxing’. It can be applied to any situation or thing that makes you feel warm and fuzzy, and you’ll hear it a lot if you visit Amsterdam in winter. Check out these roundups of brown bars , board game cafes and cosy neighbourhood bars for your gezelligheid induction. Amsterdam’s winter markets are amazing Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam does an excellent line in festive fairs; taking a more independent, unique approach than many other European cities. Every weekend through November and December, you’ll find a different market popping up somewhere in or around the city, ranging from the traditional to the trendy, selling beautiful produce and lovingly prepared food and drink in unique locations. They’re the perfect place to find art, jewellery, artisanal food products, locally designed homeware and handcrafted decorations. Shopping is usually accompanied by a soundtrack of carol singers and festive entertainment. Find out more about Amsterdam’s Christmas markets . It's a perfect Valentine's retreat Image from Jan de Ridder Amsterdam is consistently voted amongst the most romantic cities in the world, so what better destination for a loved-up Valentine's break? From romantic candle-lit restaurants and lavish hotel rooms to old-school cinema or remarkable cultural itineraries, find out more about what to do with your partner in Amsterdam on Valentine's Day . Always keep an eye on our weekend guide and cultural agenda for the best tips - from pop-up dining to cocktail masterclasses, film festivals, theatre, gigs and more to treat your partner. You can eat to your heart’s content Hearty, substantial and satisfying, Dutch cuisine was made for cold days and nights. From stamppot (traditional Dutch mash) to snert (thick pea and ham soup) and everything in between, Dutch food is designed to warm you up from the inside out. Get inspired with these warming winter dishes to try , cosy spots for comfort food , and the most beloved neighbourhood cafes to warm up in. It's oliebollen season If there’s one reason to visit Amsterdam in the winter, then oliebollen is it. These delicious balls of doughnutty goodness come out once a year, so you must eat as many as possible while you have the chance. Get them steaming hot and dusted in sugar from a street vendor, and then get some more. Need inspiration? Check out our article on the best places for oliebollen . The museums are less crowded Image from John Lewis Marshall Amsterdam is less crowded in winter, meaning shorter queues at the major museums . Save the winter months for exploring the Rembrandt House Museum, Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk , where you can shelter from the cold and then pile into a cosy brown bar afterwards. For a glimpse into Amsterdam’s past winters, look no further than the 17th-century masterpieces on display in the Rijks. Dutch landscape artists such as Hendrick Avercamp, Adam van Breen and Jan van Goyen painted emotive scenes of entire communities wrapped up warm and enjoying ice-skating, sledging, socialising and even ice fishing. Sinterklaas is coming to town Image from Amie Galbraith Unlike in other parts of the world where Father Christmas only appears after children have gone to bed, the Dutch Father Christmas is not shy of the limelight. In fact, he likes to make quite the spectacular entrance, sailing into town every winter on a kilometre-long parade of floats and boats, welcomed by upwards of 400,000 spectators. The annual Sinterklaas parade takes place in mid-November, with the feast of St Nicholas itself falling on December 5. Find out everything you need to know about the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition .

In this culturally diverse district, you’ll find all manner of exciting restaurants offering modern takes on various cuisines. There's also a wealth of breweries, cocktail bars, a fantastic range of coffee and brunch hotspots and some of the best falafel and roti in town. Coffee and lunch hotspots Image from Rum Baba Amsterdam Oost is a coffee-lover's paradise with what seems like a new espresso bar or café to try every day: The beans are roasted on-site at Rum Baba, and you can taste the difference. 4850 is a fine-dining restaurant by night, serving buns and Scandinavian-roasted coffee for sipping on the terrace by day. Coffee Bru is the spot to grab a tasty filter coffee (roasted by Rum Baba), buttery scones or a slice of toasted banana bread. Also check out: The Cottage , tHUIS aan de AMSTEL or Bakhuys to get your caffeine fix. Bar Bachrach Image from Anouk Erisman Image from Tom Flanagan Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 Lovers of modern Middle Eastern food, look no further! Bar Bachrach, located on Javaplein, is heavily inspired by the cuisines of Lebanon, Tel Aviv, and Barcelona. Expect an elevated presentation and a well-varied menu filled with inventive takes, such as the liver pate challah toast with pear chutney, shish boreks with pine nuts and yoghurt, and much more. Highlights include smoky eggplant with pomegranate molasses, lamb kofta served with tahini and pickled vegetables, and their signature freekeh salad with herbs, nuts, and citrus dressing - each dish offering a bold, balanced mix of flavours that feel both comforting and fresh. Badhuis Image from WV Productions Every neighbourhood has a spot that everyone considers the spot. In the east of Amsterdam, that place was long considered the Badhuis , a former bathhouse on the Javaplein that functioned as a place for the predominantly working-class locals to wash, meet and get together. Now it's an all-day café and brasserie, serving international fare for the community. The space is arguably the primary draw, but then so is the menu, from coffee and croissants in the morning and sandwiches in the day to classic bistro mains like mushroom ravioli and steak frites, all paired with wine, cocktails or a custom Badhuis beer. Brouwerij 't IJ Image from Koen Smilde This brewery bar under a windmill is a beer-drinking institution in Amsterdam. Brouwerij 't IJ was one of the city's first independent microbreweries, and you'll see locals proudly sporting t-shirts with their iconic ostrich logo all over town. The large enclosed terrace will be packed year-round with punters sampling classic brews like the IJwit, Flink Pale Ale and Natte Dubbel, along with new experimental creations freshly poured from the taps. You'll also find a great menu of Dutch and Belgian snacks such as ox-sausage, pickles and cheese boards to keep your stomach lined during a merry afternoon of beer tasting. Café Wu Image from Jois Ang French and Chinese food may not be the most obvious pairing, but that's precisely what makes Café Wu so inventive and enticing. Along the market street Dapperstraat, this bistro combines the best of Chinese food with the haute cuisine of French gastronomy. Here, you'll find a gorgeous open kitchen, a selection of wine bottles (over 170 to choose from), and a chef's and à la carte menu filled with some of the prettiest plates of food you'll find in Oost. Cantonese roasted duck gets a facelift in a dish of duck breast, Russian cabbage and wrapped in puff pastry, while bone marrow serves as one of the bistro's flagship dishes, com boned with veal tongue, crispy onions, chilli oil and rice. And there's even entertainment after the food from 22:00, where vinyls help set a more ambient and intimate mood. Local Dealer Image from Local Dealer Image from Local Dealer Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 One of Amsterdam's best hotspots for authentic Mexican street food , Local Dealer is a colourful diner on the Dappermarkt with a straight-to-the-point concept. Choose from a selection of ceviches, antojitos (little snacks) or tacos loaded up with everything from carne asada (grilled steak) to barbacoa lamb or Holy Pastor (their delicious vegan option with grilled pineapple). Or drop by on a Sunday for their brunch event to munch on huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos and chilaquiles with a bloody mary in hand as DJs spin funky tunes. On warm evenings, mezcals, margaritas, micheladas and bottles of Modelo beer fly off the bar towards the lively outdoor terrace - we'd recommend reserving a spot if the sun is out. Ode aan de Amstel Image from Ode aan de Amstel Perched on the Amstel with a waterside patio and unparalleled river views, Ode aan de Amstel is a new all-day dining spot for unusual but delightful dishes with an Asian twist. Dive into scallops with passionfruit foam with a wakame and pak choi salad or hand-cut steak tartare with green curry cream and matchstick fries. The tandoori-rubbed chicken and prawn skewers served with sticky lemongrass rice cubes, garlicky yoghurt and ponzu dip are also not to be missed. Tip: pick a fair-weather day to visit, as the terrace here is terrific! Krux Brouwwerf Image from KRUX Brewed in the smallest vats in Amsterdam, Krux Brouwwerf' s beer goes straight to tap and into your glass. This small-scale set-up allows Krux to experiment with tastes: you will find fourteen beers on tap that change regularly. Relax in the spacious beer garden as you quench your thirst with a fresh pint of IPA or settle into Remy's Corner inside with a platter of bitterballen to share. turbo & Buurtcafe De Tros Image from Lotte Bergman Midcentury decor, ambient lighting, teak furniture, and a gourmet croquette are just some things you'll find at all-day café turbo . The sister venture to Buurtcafe De Tros next door, turbo, is the more low-key sibling of the two, a place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in between. As a result, the menu is far-reaching, with popular choices like steak tartare, tuna, and chicken legs, all made with seasonal ingredients. There are sandwiches for lunch, too, ranging from meatball subs to katsu fish sando. But the star dish is the broodje kroket , a Dutch classic given a new twist. An oxtail croquette topped with remoulade sauce on a brioche bun, this is arguably Amsterdam's most luxe take on an old favourite. Beyond the food, you'll find great coffee from Friedhats roastery in Amsterdam and an extensive wine list, too. Wilde Zwijnen Image from Wilde Zwijnen The chefs at Wilde Zwijnen have been giving authentic Dutch dishes a contemporary facelift for over a decade now. As much as possible, the kitchen sources high-quality seasonal products from small-scale farmers in the surrounding region. Delve into a three or four-course menu which encompasses a range of creative dishes - herring caviar, tomato granita, duck stew, razor shell clams and asparagus ice cream - which showcase the very best of modern Dutch cuisine. Each plate is thoughtfully composed, balancing rustic Dutch roots with refined technique and a touch of playful surprise. Counter On one of Oost’s most vaunted (and once voted best) streets, you’ll find Counter . A veggie-focused deli in the day and wine bar at night, it hits all the markers for an all-day neighbourhood spot at exceptionally good value. In the afternoon, you’ll find a much sought-after but infrequently found lunch menu – a soup, sandwich and sweet all for €10. Come the evenings, it’s all low lights, wine and the family meal – meaning a large portion of quality food like nasi and tempeh – for €12. You’ll be hard pushed to find better value for money paired with quality and atmosphere – it’s cosy and has a string-light lit terrace – and in 2025, that’s exactly the kind of restaurant we need in Amsterdam.

This season’s newest eateries take heart in the cold, as cosy bistros, Georgian fare and bakeries stave off the winter chill. CENTRUM Editor’s Pick: Sering Centraal Best for: community eats One of the best parts of winter is the community it fosters - after all, the cold brings people together like few things can. And a lot of that coming together is around the dining table. De Sering, which has run a community space and kitchen out near Sloterdijk, is making its central debut with a new outpost at Mediamatic in what’s set to be the centre’s newest communal hub. The menu is entirely vegan and the focus is really on fostering community with free meals for Stadspas holders to a donation-based dinner for all. Lunch is Mon-Fri and priced at €7.50, with a choice of two soups and two mains, best enjoyed with Sering Centraal’s waterside views. And only a 10-minute walk from Central Station, this could well be the centre’s best value and beautiful spot. Sering Centraal | open Mon-Fri | price range €-€€ | Dijksgracht 6 Amra Best for: indulgence Nothing says comfort food quite like bread and cheese. And Amra, which just opened in the Jordaan, brings the rich and indulgent dishes of Georgian cuisine to this corner of Amsterdam. Dumplings, orange wine and khachapuri (bread boats filled with molten chees, butter and an egg yolk) are a surefire way to warm you up and satisfy whatever wintry cravings might have taken hold. Amra | open Tue-Sun, 17:00-22:00 | price range €€-€€€ | Eerste Anjeliersdwarsstraat 6 Little Bonfire Best for: Retro snugness Gather round the fire at this snug haunt near the Bloemenmarkt. Self-described as Amsterdam’s downtown living room, there’s a hint of Mad Men here with its plush interior, rich mahogany panelling and leather bar seating. Comfort food lines the menu here as dishes like pan-fried sea bass, mushroom bourguigno and flat-iron chicken star. There’s also a roster of selected wines and classic cocktails which make it easy to while away an afternoon and an evening snug under the warm lighting. Little Bonfire | open all week, times vary | price range €€-€€€ | Keizersgracht 449 OOST Hagen Oost Best for: Scandi-chic coffee An espresso bar by way of Copenhagen, this coffee spot in Watergraafsmeer stands out – and not just because of its forest-green coloured exterior. The setting is pretty grand – all geometric-patterned flooring, bare brick walls and a long, floral-printed coffee counter – but don’t be discouraged, it’s just (good) coffee after all. Grab yourself an espresso, inspired by the serene coffee tasting Copenhagen does so well; a maximal experience dressed up in minimalism. Hagen Oost | open all week, 07:30-18:00 on weekdays, 08:30-18:00 on weekends | price range €-€€ | Middenweg 59 Café Bica Best for: whitewashed escapism Should you be looking to cling to summer or draw it closer already, Café Bica can help. Situated along the Amstel River, just along from the owner's other venture Bam Boa, this sunlit space is perfect for those blue-skied winter days. A white-washed interior is simple but keeps the light filtered through, and the coffee and freshly baked pastries help keep you there. Stylish and undoubtedly a spot that’ll draw even the most reluctant De Pijp folk across the river, Bica looks to prove that the Wessperzijde really is the Amsterdam Riviera. Café Bica | open daily 08:00 - 18:00 | price range €-€€ | Weesperzijde 44 NOORD Camarat Best for: candle-lit wine Low-lit and luxurious, Camarat is a winter spot if ever there was one. Along the ever-happening Gedempt Hamerkanaal and right next to Amsterdam’s urban winery Chateau, the geometric shelves lit up by candles and floor-to-ceiling windows combine an indoor and outdoor feel. Yet even with the light, Camarat feels intimate; perhaps it’s the rich, brown textiles and furniture that does it, or the menu which spans wild duck and delicate skate (fish). Either way, come here for the kind of hushed nights winters are made for. Camarat | open Wed-Sun, opening times vary | price range €€-€€€ | Gedempt Hamerkanaal 4 Barossa Best for: bistro classics Cosy bistro fare almost never goes amiss, and add in a waterside view and you've got a perfect spot. That's Barossa, the latest spot to open in NDSM, channelling chic modernity in decor with comforting, seasonal fare on the menu. Run by the chef behind Peruvian fusion restaurant Nazka, it's no frills food here; from Caesar salads to market fish, roasted poussin and greens, plus bavette with peppercorn sauce. It's all prepared with panache from the open kitchen, and with a well-sourced wine menu and a special burger Friday deal, you'll find both class and comfort. Barossa | open Tue - Sat: 6pm - 10pm | price range €€-€€€ | Werfkade 39 WEST The Jollof Club Best for: flavour and comfort A staple of West African cuisine, jollof rice arrives in the neighbourhood in the form of Jollof Club. Named after the region’s most well-known dish, Jollof Club is a celebration of West African, serving up smoked jollof rice alongside other specials like soya chicken and rice pancakes drizzled in Scotchh Bonnet sauce. A delicious and savoury culinary experience, Jollof Club marks another chapter in De Baarsje’s expansive food journey. The Jollof Club | Open Wed–Sun, Sun Lunch only | price range €€-€€€ | Hoofdweg 141 Cheeky Best for: anytime coffee The appeal’s in the name at this brand new coffee spot in Westerpark. You'll find good brews, good tunes and good atmosphere here in this cosy space that's as much about the music as it is the coffee. Keep an eye out for special pop-ups and collaborations, which they do throughout the season and has included thai burgers and ADE dj specials. Either way, it’s a spot to hide from the cold and get communal in. Cheeky | open Tue-Fri 08:00-16:00, Sa-Su 08:00-16:30 | price range €-€€ | Fannius scholtenstraat 26H ZUID Sol Coffee Bar Best for: living room feels Everywhere wants to be a living room of Amsterdam but few actually succeed in balancing that low-key, relaxed almost effortless look-and-feel with the well-oiled machine of a good establishment. Sol makes a very respectable go at being a place that will stick around – a brocante-style space that pairs comfy seating, coffee and plenty of light to good effect. You won’t have to look far for home comforts here - the speculoos bun will do that if the apple and caramel pie hasn’t provided that already. There’s a warmth here that’ll keep you going through the season, and a no laptop policy means yes, chatting to other locals is encouraged. Sol | open Wed-Sun, 09:00-18:00 | price range €-€€ | Tweede Sweelinckstraat 6 Gorgo Lunchroom Best for: Anatolian goodness Born out of the homeland of its founders and the notion of in betweens, Gorgo Lunchroom is a celebration of modern-day Anatolia. Taking inspiration from the range of cultures that call contemporary Turkey home, Gorgo Lunchroom has a little bit of everything. Coffee, fermented drinks and sandwiches, but it’s the specific flavours on show that make it interesting. Like tahin and honey, which in their words, is “a gooey cheese melt of kaşar and Welsh cheddar, topped with tahini, honey, preserved unripe green figs, and roasted hazelnuts”, orkavurmalı : slow-roasted beef, salça, fresh thyme, kaşar and pecorino. Oh and the cookies are good too. Gorgo Lunchroom | open Tue-Sun, 08:30-17:00 | price range €-€€ | Staringplein 22 In case you missed it Boon & de Koot Cosy, bistro feels by the creators of De Zoldering and Lof wine bar, this one’s for the Dutch and French food lovers and anyone who just wants comforting dishes and wine. Boon & de Koot | open Thurs-Mon, | price range €€-€€€ | Barentszstraat 171-173 Follow our social media channels Stay up to date on events and happenings in Amsterdam, get inspiration for things to do and discover hidden gems on our dedicated @Iamsterdam Instagram and @Iamsterdam_official TikTok channel.

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/explore/winter-in-amsterdam/cultural-tips-for-amsterdam-this-winter,1,"Cultural tips for Amsterdam this winter | I amsterdam Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam Explore Amsterdam Winter in Amsterdam Cultural tips for Amsterdam this winter Image from Koen Smilde Cultural tips for Amsterdam this winter Updated 8 December 2025 at 10:14 There’s plenty to see and do this winter in Amsterdam. Light shows in the botanical gardens, a beloved classic ballet performance and a city-wide light festival are just a few things brightening Amsterdam's cultural agenda this winter. Make the most of the festive season with these tips for exploring the Dutch capital. Winter in ARTIS In collaboration with ARTIS When evening falls, ARTIS-Park reveals a different side of itself. On six special nights in December and January, visitors can experience the zoo after dark, when stars emerge, nocturnal animals become active and your senses sharpen. These evening openings highlight how animals and plants follow their natural day-and-night rhythms, with activities that show why darkness is essential for all living things. Hortus Winter Evenings Image from Jan Jaap Hubeek This winter (from 27-30 December & 2-3 January), it’s time to get cosy at one of the world’s oldest botanical gardens, Hortus Botanicus , as the doors remain open until late for Hortus Winter Evenings (Winteravonden and formerly Hortus by Night). Venture through the beautifully lit greenhouses as you discover ancient palms, tropical plants and the new Climate Greenhouse. Cuddle up by the campfire with a hot chocolate on the winter terrace and experience exclusive exhibitions featuring night-blooming flowers and much more. World Christmas Circus Image from Jan de Ridder For decades, the World Christmas Circus (18 December-5 January) at Royal Theater Carré has been one of the most popular family outings during the festive period. Marvel at the flying trapeze artists, star clowns, enchanting costumes, horse whisperers, and daredevils as award-winning acts from the most prominent circus festivals worldwide join forces in one spectacular show. The Nutcracker and the Mouse King Image from Jan de Ridder The beloved narrative of The Nutcracker and the Mouse King is reimagined on the Dutch National Opera and Ballet stage this festive season. With its lively characters and beautifully choreographed sequences created by Toer van Schayk and Wayne Eagling, this enchanted classic (12 December - 2 January) promises a magical outing at the Dutch National Opera & Ballet this winter. Amsterdam Light Festival Image from Koen Smilde photography Throughout history, light has been used as a symbol of celebration to mark the sacred passage of time. Amsterdam Light Festival , now entering its 14th year, does just that. From 27 November to 18 January, light artworks will form a 6.5km walkable trail along the streets and canals of this luminous city, designed with the theme of legacy in mind. And with the city ending the celebrations of its 750th year around the sun, this edition rounds out a momentous year for the capital. Winter Paradise Image from Tom Doms The RAI transforms into a winter wonderland during Winterparadijs (Winter Paradise) (17 December - 3 January) with indoor and outdoor ice-skating rinks, parties in the Après-Ski Village, dining options galore and fairground rides overlooking the city. Glide down a snowy slope on a tubing ride, cross-country ski through a grove of evergreen fir trees, roast marshmallows over a crackling fire, hone your curling skills or goof off in a playful snowball fight. When it’s time to take a break from all the fun, head to the Winter Cinema and cosy up with nostalgic festive classics National Tulip Day Image from Pauline Arkesteijn Already anticipating the arrival of spring? Prepare to celebrate the start of tulip season when Dutch tulip growers invite everyone to partake in a delightful tradition – picking your own bouquet of tulips for free at a picking garden in Museumplein, all in honour of National Tulip Day on January 17, 2025. This coming day marks the 13th edition of this beloved event. Join tens of thousands of fellow flower enthusiasts as they herald the new season's arrival. Get cultural at Museumplein As the name suggests, you’ll find some of the city’s most famous museums gathered around this square in Oud-Zuid : The Van Gogh Museum presents Metamorphoses , where passion, desire, lust, jealousy, cunning and deceit come to life in this Ovid-inspired showcase (from 6 February). This exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum looks to paint yellow in a different way, as something more than just a pretty shade. Through works by Van Gogh and his contemporaries, this exploration examines the meaning of yellow as a symbol of light and courage (13 February onwards). The Stedelijk Museum, one of the country's premier contemporary art museums, presents works by Erwin Olaf , exploring the life and legacy of one of the Netherlands’ most celebrated photographers (until 1 March). See the best photography Amsterdam packs a punch when it comes to photography. With several museums dedicated to the medium, along with major festivals and commercial galleries, there’s always something to see: Explore the subterranean and ethereal world of female Japanese divers, as captured by photographer Kusukazu Uraguchi at Huis Marseille's Shima no Ama exhibition . For thirty years, Uraguchi dedicated himself to capturing the ama (woman of the sea). What he was left with is this exhibition: a collection of eighty photographs that examine the otherworldly vocation of these women and their lesser-known lives (until 8 February). Head to Foam for Co Rentmeester's Witnessing Life , a Dutch photographer who helped shape the 20th century's visual culture, namely through his award-winning sports photography, including the now world-famous Jumpman image of Michael Jordan from 1984 (until 11 February). Get out of town Image from peter tijhuis This November marks 50 years of Surinamese independence. And Museum Cobra is commemorating that milestone with a special exhibition dedicated entirely to Surinamese Art, where around 24 artists and one collective will present their works on what Surinamese freedom means (until 1 March). At Singer Laren , follow Vivian Ammerlaan, a Dutch painter, and her journey into the Rocky Mountains, as told through moody, spectral paintings (25 Nov - 18 January). The Teyler's Museum , just a stone's throw from Amsterdam in the heart of historic Haarlem, is the Netherlands' oldest museum and features an expansive collection of art, natural history and science. Check out ‘ Michelangelo and Men ’ as one of the world's oldest thinkers takes centre stage (until 25 January).

Follow the top 5 tips below to skip the ticket booth queues, avoid the biggest crowds and experience some of the city's highlights! Always plan and pre-book Image from Koen Smilde It’s great to wander around Amsterdam and enjoy whatever awaits you. But if you have the luxury of pre-booking tickets for museums and attractions , the most significant benefit is showing up when it suits you and avoiding the lines at the ticket booths (just be careful to follow the signs to the correct door).

Time is on your side Image from Mirte Vreemann Image from Christian van der Kooy Previous slide Next slide 1 / 3 Slide 1 of 3 Remember that many museums in Amsterdam don't just stick to the nine-to-five routine! Here's our guide to art after dark: late opening museums in Amsterdam . The Van Gogh Museum is open every Friday evening until 21:00. Why not book your timeslot around 17:00 on a Friday? The museum is quieter as crowds disperse for dinner, allowing more personal and precious moments to enjoy the artworks. The Rijksmuseum (free with the I amsterdam City Card ) notes that April, May and August are the busiest months and that Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the most popular days. As such, waiting times can be around 30 minutes. But if you’d really like a bit more space to enjoy the museum, their advice is to either arrive in time for opening (9:00) or at the end of the afternoon (after 15:00). There’s always great demand to experience the famous canal-side Anne Frank House . Throughout the year it’s common to see queues stretching around the block, often with waiting times of 45 minutes (up to 2 hours at peak times). The advice from the Anne Frank House is to purchase your ticket in advance, but it’s also well worth stopping by for an evening visit – from April until August, the museum is open until 22:00. The Stedelijk Museum is open till 21:00 on Fridays, and the photography museum Foam is open till 21:00 on Thursdays and Fridays. Always check the websites of your favourite museums for extra opening hours and special events. See the city by bike Image from Robin Utrecht Taking to two wheels and having the city pass you by feels especially ‘Amsterdam’. But if you’re not a frequent cyclist and don’t know your way, the crowded streets and the hustle and bustle around hotspots like Dam Square and Leidseplein can feel intimidating. Here's a guide to cycling in Amsterdam for some tips on getting around. And if the mere thought of cycling amidst cars and trams sets your pulse racing, check out the variety of cycleseeing routes into the countryside . Within 20 minutes of the city centre, you can be in the spacious fields and off to windmills, traditional farms and clog makers.

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/amsterdam-like-a-local,1,"Best ways to experience Amsterdam like a local | I amsterdam Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam See and do Experience Amsterdam like a local Image from Adobe Stock Experience Amsterdam like a local Updated 1 April 2025 at 14:19 You’ve been to the biggest museums, toured the canals and seen enough tulips to last a lifetime – but how can you experience the city like a real Amsterdammer? Here are a few tips for how to do as the locals do in Amsterdam along with some further insights into what makes life special in the Dutch capital. Don’t get stuck in one neighbourhood Image from Koen Smilde Photography With all the museums , theatres , wonky pubs and staggeringly gorgeous canals, most first time visitors are so taken by the city centre that they don’t leave the canal ring - we don't blame you! But when you’ve had enough of all those incessantly ringing church bells, do as the locals do and hop around the many different neighbourhoods of Amsterdam. For hidden coffee spots, alternative gig venues and trendy boutiques head to Oud-West . Take the free ferry to NDSM for industrial-chic dining, impressive street art and vintage shopping. Or explore the bustling street markets, lively cafe terraces and hottest new restaurants in De Pijp . These neighbourhood guides are packed full of recommendations for cultural hotspots, walking tours, family-friendly things to do, hidden gems or simply where to find the best sandwich. Go off-grid Image from Jan de Ridder Amsterdammers love a good party, and you’ll find plenty of live music venues and clubs to dance your troubles away in. Some of the best underground music happens in the city’s lesser-known venues or as part of major festivals like Amsterdam Dance Event . When it comes to other cultural events , you’ll find so much to explore beyond the mainstream. The city boasts a wealth of independent boutique cinemas and unusual museums , whilst our lovingly curated Weekend Guide will keep you in the know of the best off-grid happenings. Shop at local markets Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam's bustling street markets are a great place to get a sense of how locals shop and the diverse range of produce and cuisines available in the Netherlands. Our firm favourites are the Ten Katemarkt in Oud-West and Dappermarkt in Oost , packed with vendors selling flowers, fish, cheeses, fabric, fruit and veg. You’ll also find a range of food trucks serving up typical Dutch snacks and deep-fried delicacies. If you haven’t yet had the opportunity to sample kibbeling (battered cod bites served with herby mayo), loempia (Indonesian spring roll) or a broodje haring (a raw herring sandwich), the city's street markets are the place to start! Only eat fried snacks for dinner Image from Alex Cheuk The vrijmibo (Friday afternoon drinking session) is a well-loved pastime in Amsterdam and involves heading to a bruin cafe ( brown bar ) with friends or colleagues to indulge in beers and snacks - the more deep-fried, the better. Delicacies like bitterballen (crispy meatballs served with mustard) or borrelnootjes (deep-fried nuts - yes, you read that correctly) are designed to hold off hunger just enough to keep the conversation going until closing time. If you’re still peckish, you can always stop by a FEBO vending machine for a nutritious frikandel (fried sausage) to eat on the walk home - lekker! Here's a round-up of Dutch foods to try in Amsterdam for some further explanation of the fried food phenomenon. Try not to get distracted by dogs on bicycles Image from Pema Prima If you’re feeling confident enough to brave the cycle paths, a bike rental is a superb way to get across the city. You’ll witness some exceptionally cute things: dogs feeling the wind in their fur or five toddlers piled into a bakfiets . Try not to get distracted, as these are extremely normal occurrences. Other eyebrow-raising sights include Amsterdammers peddling with no hands, singing as they cycle or balancing absurdly bulky objects - a standing lamp, a surfboard, a flatscreen TV - on their handlebars. We don’t recommend attempting any of the above (except maybe the singing thing, because the world needs more of that). Fancy venturing further afield, here's a great selection of cycle routes that head out of the city in the gorgeous wilds of the Amsterdam Area . Give the language a go Image from Marie-Charlotte Pezé With those tough g ’s and haunting vowel sounds, Dutch has a bad rep for being one of the harder languages to get your tongue around. In reality, there are many aspects of learning Dutch that make it surprisingly easy for English-speakers. Many words are very recognisable: koffie , bier , museum , appeltaart , hotel - to name a few. Not to mention that Dutch speakers tend to use leuk (nice), lekker (tasty) and gezellig (cosy) to describe almost every situation. Honestly, if you can manage those three adjectives, combined with super (really) or niet (not), then you’re halfway fluent. Strive to achieve gezelligheid Image from Amie Galbraith So there’s this word, gezellig , which is a fundamental part of Dutch national identity - perhaps even more so than stroopwafels . Loosely translated it means ‘a warm atmosphere’, ‘cosy’, ‘pleasant’ or ‘togetherness’ and can be used to describe either a setting or a person. Amsterdammers take a lot of pride in gezelligheid and to truly experience the city like a local, you’ll need to plan your activities with this concept in mind. Keep everything relaxed and sociable and surround yourself with people that make you feel good. You might while away the afternoon people watching from an authentic brown bar or take the time to catch up with an old friend over brunch . Ask yourself at all times: how can I make this situation more pleasant and comfortable? That picnic in the park can always be improved by extra cushions or additional snacks, for instance. Take holidays seriously as the Dutch do Image from Amie Galbraith If you’re lucky enough to visit Amsterdam on a national holiday, getting into the festive mood will be a requirement. On April 27, every street, park, balcony and canal will be awash with orange-clad revellers for King’s Day and participation will be near impossible to avoid. On New Year’s Eve , many locals will call upon their nearest friend with a terrace to watch the fireworks whilst gorging on oliebollen and champagne. And it’s always worth remembering that Sinterklaas on December 5 is not simply ‘Dutch Christmas’. Sint’s annual arrival in the city is a hotly anticipated event with a unique set of customs surrounding it, not to mention excessive gift-giving that is taken very seriously . Read up on all these major events and celebrations before your trip and get swept up into the party spirit. Congratulate everyone at a birthday party Image from Winnie Verswijvel Birthdays are equally important in the Netherlands. Many Dutch homes feature a calendar of upcoming birthdays in the toilet to ensure that none slide past uncelebrated (don’t even try it, you won’t get away with it). For the uninitiated, birthday parties themselves can be slightly odd affairs. Rather than saying ‘happy birthday’, the traditional greeting is gefeliciteerd (congratulations) which you must say to everybody in attendance - not just to the birthday boy or girl. The birthday cake tradition still stands, but you will have to buy your own if it’s your special day. This guide to the best cake shops in Amsterdam has got you covered. Arrive at a bar, on a boat Image from Ode aan de Amstel You’ve probably already noticed that Amsterdam has quite a few canals. But did you know that in many places, you can rock up to a waterfront bar, on a boat . Whilst many locals have their own or share one between friends, there are plenty of locations across the city where you can rent a boat yourself. At some bars you might not even have to disembark to order your food and drinks - how convenient is that?

Take a paddle board along the River Amstel, relax by the water in Flevopark or test your balance with an adventure sport like windsurfing or rock climbing. Here’s our roundup of the best spots to get active and outdoors in Oost. Oosterpark Image from Jan de Ridder Image from Jan de Ridder Previous slide Next slide 1 / 2 Slide 1 of 2 From cultural festivals such as Keti Koti to picnic opportunities overlooking the water, Oosterpark offers something for everyone. Perhaps one of the city’s most stunning parks, this beautiful green space has a paddling pool for children to splash in, plenty of areas for sporty activities (like rollerblading and jogging) and various outdoor sculptures to admire. There’s even a bandstand where dance classes take place, and it is one of the few parks in Amsterdam where you can still barbecue, making it an excellent option for warm summer evenings. Park Frankendael Image from Merijn Roubroeks In the 17th and 18th centuries, dozens of imposing summer residences owned by wealthy Amsterdammers lined the streets of Amsterdam Oost. Today, only Huize Frankendael remains. The large garden around Huize Frankendael was partly opened up as a pleasure garden in the 19th century and was later used as a city nursery. Today Park Frankendael is a popular neighbourhood hangout and the art and culture garden of Oost. Within the park, you’ll find Restaurant De Kas situated within a giant greenhouse which sources ingredients from its very own kitchen garden. Flevopark Image from Koen Smilde Surrounded by vast swathes of water, the unique location of Flevopark makes it the ideal location to spot wildlife and lesser-seen plant species. Strolling through this lush green area, you’ll see sights you don't often encounter in Amsterdam, including rare birds like the kingfisher who lives by the lake near Distillerij 't Nieuwe Diep . It's the ideal spot for dog-walking, picnicking and sunbathing along with the trendy residents of Amsterdam Oost. Looking for even more adventure? Flevopark also boasts a delightful open-air swimming pool, Flevoparkbad , and the largest adventure playground in Amsterdam: Jeugdland . Along the Amstel Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam-Oost is flanked by the broad Amstel River, which winds its way South into some spectacular green countryside. There’s an excellent Amstel River cycle route which passes the ornamental gardens and allotments of Tuinpark Amstelglorie , then heads along the Duivendrecht polder in the direction of the historic village Ouderkerk aan de Amstel. The Amstel is also an excellent spot for rowing, boating or trying your hand at Supping and canoeing. Check out the rental centres at Kano & Sup Amsterdam and SUP rental . One of the numerous rowing clubs in Amsterdam is The Berlagebrug Rowing Center , directly on the River Amstel which offers classes, private lessons and tours. Surfcenter IJburg Image from Strand IJburg Within easy reach of the city centre and Amsterdam-Oost, IJburg is a watersports paradise. Surfcenter IJburg offers windsurf classes for all levels, including those who have never stepped onto a board and those who want to train to be an instructor. All equipment is provided, and Blijburg Beach, where the clubhouse is situated, is the perfect spot to hang loose and watch that glorious Dutch sunset. Ultimate frisbee Image from Husky - CC BY 4.0 Ultimate frisbee is one of the fastest-growing team sports in the world; a fun an accessible game where points are scored by throwing the frisbee to a team member in the end zone. Amsterdam is getting in on the fun, with more and more ultimate frisbee fans in town. Amsterdam Ultimate Club in Oost is one of the main clubs in town and their outdoor training sessions take place at Sportpark Drieburg. Of course, you can also read up on the rules online, grab a frisbee from a toy shop and head to the nearest park with a bunch of friends. Jaap Eden Ice Rink Image from Jaap Eden Baan The colossal Jaap Eden skating rink, open from October to March, is the go-to spot for amateurs and pros alike to develop their skills. Budding speedskaters can make use of the 400-metre track, which allows you to glide through quite a few laps in your own lane without having to swerve for children. But don’t worry, if you haven’t nailed your double axels yet, there’s an indoor rink and a beginners corner. Jaap is the home turf of the Amstel Tijgers, so be sure to check the schedule for ice hockey matches, discos and a variety of other public activities. De Vergulden Eenhoorn Image from Vergulden Eenhoorn If you’re looking for more gentle exercise, perhaps the kind you can do with a glass of wine in hand, look no further than De Vergulden Eenhoorn . This historic country pub conceals one of Amsterdam’s best-kept secrets: its very own jeu de boules pitch. If a quick round of petanque is still too much exertion for you, why not lounge around in the deckchairs of the beautiful secluded garden as drinks and snacks are brought to you?

Amsterdam,https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/restaurant-and-bars/dutch-winter-foods-to-eat-in-amsterdam,1,"Dutch winter foods to eat in Amsterdam | I amsterdam Skip to main content Discover Amsterdam Live, Work and Study Meetings and Conventions Business English Discover Amsterdam What's on See and do Travel and stay City Card and tickets Discover Amsterdam See and do Restaurants and bars Essential Dutch winter foods to eat in Amsterdam Essential Dutch winter foods to eat in Amsterdam Updated 10 December 2025 at 13:34 As the cold sets in, slip into something elasticated and eat your way around Amsterdam with these seasonal Dutch delights from erwtensoep and stamppot to appeltaart or pancakes. Snert It’s green. It’s more delicious than it looks. It’s snert . Often, you’ll see it called erwtensoep or Hollandse erwtensoep but it all means the same. Snert is emblematic of Dutch winter cuisine, and it’s the ultimate winter warmer: a thick pea soup packed with onions, celery, leeks, carrots and sliced rookworst (smoked sausage), traditionally served with rye bread and smoky bacon. Stop by some of Amsterdam's best Dutch food restaurants to try it. Fondue Image from Proeflokaal van Wees It may not have its origins in the Netherlands, but fondue has a special place in the hearts of all Dutchies. Few things are cosier than huddling around a cauldron of hot melted cheese with a bottle of red on a winter’s night, which is why the Swiss staple has become a mainstay in the Lowlands. There are plenty of places in Amsterdam to get your fondue fix, and we've even put together a selection of the very best fondues to make life easier and, dare we say, cheesier. Stamppot Stamppot is a big lovely mess of mashed potato mushed up with other vegetables, including sauerkraut, kale, spinach or turnip greens. Sometimes the potato is smashed with carrots and turnips, and then it’s called hutspot . You’ll typically find it served with a generously portioned rookworst (smoked sausage) or a pork chop at one of these traditional Dutch restaurants . Suddervlees Image from Moeders Looks aren't everything. Suddervlees literally means ""braised meat"" which translates on the plate to a big hearty beef and ale stew. It makes absolutely no attempt to look attractive (see picture), but with its punchy combo of slow cooked meat, beer, onions and seasoning, it’s winter on a plate for many people in the Netherlands. Get it with frites to mop up all that lovely gravy at one of these traditional Dutch restaurants . Oliebollen Image from Koen Smilde Photography Oliebollen (which translates to ""oily balls"" – yum?) are so special that you can only get them for a few short winter months. Traditionally eaten on New Year’s Eve, they’re deep-fried dough balls dusted with powdered sugar and studded with raisins and currants. Look out for the oliebollenkramen (stalls), which appear around Amsterdam in mid-October, and eat as many as possible before they disappear for another year. These are our picks of the best places to find them. Poffertjes Repeat slowly: ""Poff-fert-jus."" Now that you know how to say it, you have no excuse for not ordering trays and trays of these tiny pancake treats while you’re in Amsterdam. Get them steaming hot from a street vendor, slathered in melty butter and powdered sugar, and devour them whole. Here's our round-up of the best poffertjes spots to treat yourself on a cold winter's day. Pannenkoeken Image from The Pancake Bakery Nice things about eating massive pannenkoeken (pancakes) in winter: everything. Thankfully, pancakes are as ubiquitous as bicycles in Amsterdam, so drizzle them in syrup and sugar and let the good times roll. Take a look at some of our favourite pancake houses if you need inspiration. Chocoladeletters and pepernoten Image from Amie Galbraith Go into any food store in November or early December (pre-Sinterklaas), and you will probably see many giant letters made from chocolate. These chocoladeletters are an integral Sinterklaas tradition in the Netherlands, given as gifts to reflect the first letter of the recipient’s name. It’s also absolutely fine to buy them for yourself. Likewise, you'll see the supermarket shelves stacked high with pepernoten ( speculaas- spiced mini biscuits), which are eaten by thousands of spectators as Sinterklaas makes his customary under-the-radar arrival into the city, with a massive canal parade known as the Sinterklaas Intocht . Chocomel Image from Koen Smilde Wrapping your hands around a mug of hot chocolate milk on a winter’s day is one of life’s simple pleasures. You’ll find hot chocolate (usually found on menus under 'Chocomel') at most cafes and street markets in Amsterdam - ask for yours with a splash of rum if you want to feel a bit adventurous. These are our favourite spots for an indulgent cup . Appeltaart Holland’s national pastry comes into its own in the winter months, and there’s nothing more enjoyable than sitting on a heated terrace on a crisp winter’s day, tucking into a thick slice of freshly baked apple pie. Appeltaart (Dutch apple pie) is a thing of wonder: with layers of sliced apple tightly packed under a layer of yummy doughy pastry. A couple of cafes are often said to have the best appeltaart in Amsterdam, but there can be only one winner – so make up your own mind with this list of the best appeltaart in Amsterdam.

Whether you're looking for the best places to cycle in Amsterdam or planning to join a guided bike tour, knowing the essential cycling rules and practising safe cycling is key. So grab a bike and experience Amsterdam like a local! Cycling in Amsterdam Play video Amsterdam: a cycling city Image from Oleh Slobodeniuk via iStock The narrow, winding streets of Amsterdam's historic 17th-century city centre are definitely best navigated by bike. And with up to 400 kilometres of bicycle paths leading just about everywhere in town, it's no wonder that Amsterdam is a true cycling city. Renting a bike or taking a guided cycle tour is a great way to discover the city and can be quite an adventure. Plus, if you're inexperienced or nervous about traffic, the expert guides and rental shops can set you up and offer great advice. Bike rentals in Amsterdam Image from Roos Trommelen Photography Bicycles can be rented in all parts of the city. Especially around Central Station, Leidseplein and hotels, you can find many rental companies. Bike rental is often possible from 3 hours per day, the average daily rental price is €10. Locals find nothing more irritating than a lousy cyclist, so make sure you follow the (unwritten) rules of the road! Check out all bike hire locations . Best places to cycle in Amsterdam Image from Koen Smilde Wondering where you should cycle in Amsterdam? Explore more of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam Area with our Cycleseeing routes . Each trail will take you off the beaten track to discover old and new architecture, urban forests, beaches, polders, parks and waterways. The idea is to take your time and enjoy the scenery. Just see what you feel like seeing. On all the routes we suggest places to eat, drink and rest. There are shortcuts and detours for extra special attractions. All routes are offered in the (free) route planner tool Komoot. Rules for safe cycling in Amsterdam Image from Alain Rouiller Cycling in the city can be hectic, especially if you're not used to Amsterdam-style traffic. Here are a few things to keep in mind after you hire a bicycle: Stay in your lane: use the bicycle lane on the right-hand side of the road, marked out by white lines and bike symbols. Follow the rules of the road: adhere to all traffic lights and signs; don’t cycle on footpaths, shopping streets, pavements and motorways. It’s required by law to use front and back lights on your bicycle after dark. Give a sign: always signal before turning by putting your hand out. Watch out for tram rails: it’s easy to get your tires stuck in the rails – cross them at a sharp angle. Park it right: make sure to park your bike in a designated bike parking section, rack or indoor parking facility, as bikes that are not parked in the right areas may be removed and stored in the Bicycle Depot. And to avoid theft, lock your bike to something secure and immovable. Make room for fellow cyclists: don’t bike more than two people across, keep pace with the other cyclists, and pull over to answer your phone or check the map. Avoid rush hour : between 08:00 and 09:00 or 17:00 and 18:00, thousands of bikes are on the road, often resulting in big queues at junctions. If you don't need to be somewhere, wait until the rush calms down. Don’t imitate the Dutch: Amsterdammers are notorious for breaking the rules: cycling through red lights or biking at night without lights. Do not follow their example! Bicycle parking and removal Image from Bryony Rijks To avoid having your bicycle removed in the city, it is advisable to only park your bike at designated racks or a dedicated parking garage ( stalling ). Some locations allow you to leave your bike for up to two weeks, and some for up to six weeks. Read the City of Amsterdam's bicycle parking guidelines for further information or view the parking locations on a map . If a bike is found or removed due to illegal parking, it will be delivered to the Fietsdepot who can then use the engraving to inform legal owners that their bike has been found or recovered. If you have lost your (engraved) bike, you can contact the Fietsdepot to check if it has been recovered by calling 14020 during office hours. If they have it, you need to pay a fee of €25 to reclaim your bike, or approximately €40 to have it delivered to your home. You will need to show identification and have the key to the bike lock in your possession. Check the Fietsdepot website for more information.

Start your New Year’s fitness regime with a dip in the sea at Zandvoort aan Zee on  January 1. This tradition is in its 60th year and attracts brave swimmers from all around the Netherlands. There were plenty of brave divers rushing into the sea, even more fun was that friends and family were there to cheer them on and plenty lifeguards just in case they were needed. Lets hope that on January 1, 2025 it will be such a party again.

It doesn't matter if you are young, old, man or woman, because from grandchild to grandparent everyone is welcome. Registration is completely free and can be done in advance via the website or on the day itself. After registration you will receive a nice but especially warm present. After the dive you also get a cup of warm pea soup and a certificate. Before you jump into the water there is a special warm-up with nice music. Then you take off your clothes and as soon as the starting signal has been given you run with thousands of others towards the sea for a refreshing dip.

The Wereldmuseum houses a must-visit collection of intriguing artefacts, Studio/K is a hotspot for arthouse film and Bradwolff Projects is a curated contemporary art venue that brings exciting new works to the fore. You'll also find a variety of warehouse spaces, churches and former factories that have been taken over by a range of artistic initiatives, transforming Oost into an epicentre for culture in Amsterdam. Studio/K Image from Studio/K Run by a team of enthusiastic students, Studio/K is a forward-looking centre which functions as an arthouse cinema, a music venue, a gallery and a bar-restaurant. The two screening rooms lay on an outstanding range of quality films focusing on cinema that has emerged from outside Hollywood, including countries such as Turkey, Morocco and India. You'll find an equally impressive array of eclectic club nights, festivals, markets and other open-air activities which extend outdoors to the spacious terrace. Meanwhile, the gig agenda encompasses everything from singer-songwriter and jazz to rock and electronic. Wereldmuseum Amsterdam Image from Rob van Esch The expansive, light-drenched Wereldmuseum Amsterdam houses a fascinating three-storey collection of intriguing artefacts from around the globe, each with its own story to tell about world cultures, past and present. Presented in insightful and imaginative displays, the Things That Matter permanent exhibition considers themes that connect people across borders, whilst Afterlives of Slavery brings to light the history of slavery and its modern-day repercussions. Kids can get stuck into the Wereldmuseum Amsterdam Junior , which uses hands-on exhibits to promote an open view of the world. Suriname Museum Image from 24 uur Oost The Suriname Museum is dedicated to the culture, history, and people of Suriname. It was born out of the demand to give voice to the Suriname diaspora in Amsterdam and beyond. The museum is a multi-floor museum complete with an extensive library, Surinamese café, and garden. The opening exhibition, Meet Su!, aims to introduce visitors to Suriname and the diaspora while exploring the 350 years of Surinamese-Dutch relations. Bradwolff Projects Image from paul vos de wael Bradwolff Projects is an experimental contemporary art platform tucked away in a former hospital on the Linnaeusstraat. With its picturesque exterior and striking domed ceiling, the space provides a unique backdrop for innovative exhibitions and collaborative projects with art and research institutions. Its exhibitions spotlight interdisciplinary art that explores themes of identity, landscape, and ecology. Plein Theatre Image from Paulina Matusiak & Eddy Wenting Plein Theater is a unique theatre in Amsterdam Oost, offering topical and diverse programming for children, youth, and adults. Their small-scale, intimate performances include modern dance, youth theatre, modern chamber music, and experimental theatre. In addition, the production house makes theatre projects inspired by historical and cultural themes from the world around us. P/////AKT Project Space Image from Chun-Han Chiang This not-for-profit exhibition space has provided a robust platform for emerging talents in the city since 2003. Multiple times a year, the sprawling warehouse is given over to individual artists to produce new works related to the specific location. These large-scale solo presentations give viewers a real insight into each artist's thought process and the opportunity to catch one of their early-career shows before they undoubtedly go on to exciting bigger things. Framer Framed Image from Framer Framed / Eva Broekema Curators and artists collide at this long-standing project space and arts foundation in the cultural epicentre of Amsterdam Oost. Every year, the venue collaborates with emerging and established international talents to organise exhibitions and an extensive public programme of lectures, debates, screenings and performances. You'll be confronted with work at the cutting edge of contemporary art, visual culture and politics from a diverse range of voices and perspectives in society. Canvas and Doka Image from Doka / Volkshotel Located on the roof of the Volkshotel, a former office building where the national newspaper de Volkskrant once rolled off the press, Canvas op de 7de is a rooftop bar with panoramic city views and fantastic cocktails. The terrace has to be one of the best places to hang out in Amsterdam, and when it gets late, party-people can move downstairs to Doka to check out the varied live music agenda and club nights. Museum Tot Zover Image from Museum Tot Zover If you're interested in how the Dutch approach the inevitability of death, then the Museum Tot Zover (Funeral Museum) is just the ticket. Tot Zover offers an array of changing contemporary and historical exhibitions featuring art and photography, plus a growing selection of online galleries delving deep into our relationship with the afterlife. As befitting a funeral museum, it's located in a cemetery - the only Dutch museum to be – and housed in the former director's residence. Q-Factory Image from Rein Kooyman The biggest music-making centre in Europe, Q-Factory offers musicians, actors and dancers all kinds of opportunities to rehearse, perform and record. Enjoy live music in one of the halls, have a Q-Burger or ice-cold beer in the café-restaurant or stay overnight in the music hotel. NedPhOKoepel Image from Ronald Knapp This former church In the Indische Buurt is the home base for the Netherlands Philharmonic and Chamber Orchestras. Anyone who loves music is welcome to attend free open rehearsals and children's concerts in the spectacular surroundings, known for their impressive acoustics.

Kilometres and kilometres of beaches and fun Valencia's beaches: within the city limits or wild, the choice is yours! If you like golden sands by the sea. When the view, swayed by the salt water of the Mediterranean or hiding in the dunes, with a smile on your face. When you want to bathe in the sun on your towel (always with a good sunscreen) or relax under a parasol with a drink nearby. Or if you like to exercise, swim or do any kind of sport on sand, on water or in the air... then your place in the world is the beaches of Valencia. Without doubt the best plan. There are urban ones, just a stone's throw from the city centre, full of restaurants and leisure facilities and with a very wide promenade. And also in the surrounding area, right in the L'Albufera Nature Park. Listen to the sound of the waves, feel the aroma of the salt?  Open your eyes and enjoy. You have reached your destination. 20 kilometres of sand and sea Didn't you know that in Valencia there are almost 20 kilometres of beach waiting for you? Well, that's right. You just must make up your mind and come with the time to get to know them all! They are ideal for letting your adventurous vein run free, or for enjoying them more secluded and romantic. Combine swimming and hiking or enjoy a privileged climate with your favourite mascot. The beaches are close to you, like those in Cabanyal, Malvarrosa and neighbouring Patacona, where you can afford the luxury of walking to the beach if you wish. Or a little further away, in the green lung of the capital. This is the case of the beaches in El Saler, La Devesa and La Garrofera and many others. But now you can reach them all by bicycle; they are all wide, with sand between white and golden, and the sea water is of exceptional quality. It is no coincidence that all of them fly blue flags, symbol of the highest quality. A thousand possibilities are open to you to bury stress and fatigue and make ""carpe diem"" the leitmotif of your life: What would you like a cold drink or your snack? You did not bring a hammock or parasol? Then rent them comfortably or go to one of the kiosks. Do you accept the challenge of the beaches of Valencia? Follow us and we will show you everything.

Valencia,https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-do-valencia/gastronomy/what-to-eat/where-eat-paella-valencia,1,"Where to eat paella in Valencia | Paella Valencia Skip to main content EN Language selector es en nl fr de it va 0 Search button Search Submit Search Close Mobile menu expander Where to eat a good paella in Valencia System messages Close popup share whatsapp facebook twitter linkedin Where to eat a good paella in Valencia Paella is Valencian cuisine’s most international dish, our contribution to global gastronomy. Paella is to Valencia what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris or the aqueduct to Segovia, an extraordinary landmark. With the difference being that ours is made from rice , vegetables from our farming region , l' Horta , and animal protein such as chicken , free-range if possible, and rabbit . Or if you prefer, there is the seafood version, with the finest raw material from the Mediterranean. This is the best example of the pairing of locally sourced products in human history! You find yourself in the best city in the world to get paella. You won't want to leave Valencia without treating yourself. If you sample a good paella in Valencia, you are sure to repeat the experience. To find out which spots you can trust , you can turn to wikipaella, an initiative to honour and promote the original recipe, or go to Visit Valencia’s rice restaurants section. Once you're in good hands, let yourself go. All you need worry about is what sort of surroundings you'd like to be in when savouring your paella: overlooking the Mediterranean? historic district? City of Arts and Sciences? The choice is yours. Enjoy the view and the food. ​​​​ AT THE BEACH Try the Valencian or seafood paella, but with the sea breeze as a companion in any of the establishments of the genuine Cabanyal, the vibrant Malvarrosa or the avant-garde Marina de Valencia , the city's three hot spots by the sea. The relationship between our beaches and rice is a love story you should be part of: ingredients from the sea and countryside of Valencia, the result of having such a well-stocked natural pantry. Get some starters too: clóchinas (small mussels) in season, cuttlefish or squid, and dishes such as esgarraet or titaina . You're in the best place to try them! Casa Carmela Casa Carmela Casa Isabel Casa Isabel El Coso Del Mar El Coso Del Mar Vlue Arribar Vlue Arribar La Alegría de La Huerta La Alegría de La Huerta Tridente (Hotel Neptuno) Tridente (Hotel Neptuno) La Marítima de Veles e Vents La Marítima de Veles e Vents IN THE HISTORIC CENTER The center of Valencia is one of the largest in Europe and over 2,000 years old; a history as extensive as the number of places where you can eat a good paella. Valencia has dozens of places that do rice right. Valencia is home to the masters of traditional, authentic Valencian paella, the one made with local ingredients. Goya Gallery Restaurant Goya Gallery Restaurant Borja Azcutia Borja Azcutia La Cigrona La Cigrona Palace Fesol Palace Fesol Llisa Negra Llisa Negra Juliana Restaurante Juliana Restaurante IN THE ALBUFERA L’Albufera is the cradle of Valencian paella , the place where it was created back in the 16th century by farm workers, who made it with whatever they got from the land. Now they follow their own traditions, and restaurants in the area make it with rice grown in and around the Natural Park and with local vegetables and poultry. An ideal excuse to visit the natural park and enjoy our most international dish. Nou Racó Nou Racó Restaurante El Palmar Restaurante El Palmar Bon Aire Restaurante We're Smart Green Guide1 Bon Aire Restaurante Casa Quiquet Casa Quiquet IN THE HUERTA Valencia is surrounded by fruit and vegetable farms and here, in the farmland, you can taste a Valencian paella made with the freshest ingredients.

If you come to Valencia a visit to the City of Arts and Sciences is a must. Work of the Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava, several of its buildings have become icons in the city. It is a scientific and cultural leisure complex which can be enjoyed with family or friends, covering around two kilometres of the former riverbed of the River Turia. You will need tickets to enter the Hemisfèric, the Science Museum and the Oceanogràfic, and you can buy them separately or combined for the buildings that you would most like to visit. Be sure to plan your trip to the City of Arts and Sciences, because there is a lot to see. To visit the entire City of Arts and Sciences complex, it's best to have at least one day to explore it . We recommend buying your tickets in advance to avoid queues and ensure entry. buy your ticket Oceanogràfic No trip to Valencia is complete without visiting the Oceanogràfic, Europe's biggest aquarium. With seven different marine environments, almost 45,000 specimens of 500 different species can be seen, such as dolphins, belugas, walruses, sea lions, seals, penguins and sharks. Don't miss the exhibition taking place daily in the dolphinarium. Reserve at least half a day for the trip. buy your ticket Hemisfèric The Hemisfèric is a digital 3D cinema, with a huge 900 metre concave screen, which almost envelops spectators. Several films are screened daily, mainly educational documentaries of no more than 45 minutes which are suitable for all audiences. You will receive a pair of innovative 3D glasses with your ticket enabling you to change the screening language. If you are travelling with children, there is usually a film geared towards children once a day. We recommend that you check the film listings and reserve the screening that you would like to see before starting your visit to other buildings of the City of Arts and Sciences. buy your ticket Science Museum With the philosophy ""Not touching is prohibited"" you can imagine what kind of museum this is. The Science Museum offers different interactive exhibitions about science and technology. You can visit without entering the ground floor, where there is usually a temporary exhibition, some shops, the bathrooms and a restaurant. You will need a ticket for the remaining exhibitions. The Museum also offers scientific workshops for all visitors for which you will have to buy a separate ticket. buy your ticket Palau de les Arts If you are a music-lover then the Palau de les Arts is the place for you at the City of Arts and Sciences. From October to November, its programme includes operas, concerts, zarzuela and ballet. When not being used for performances, you can visit the building by booking in advance on the website. buy your ticket Umbracle The Umbracle is a huge, open-access garden covering more than 17,000 m 2 where you can stroll around and take in the typical Mediterranean plants and contemporary sculptures. Terraza Mya opens its doors at night during the summer months, where you can have a drink under the moonlight. The public car park of the City of Arts and Sciences is located just below the Umbracle. Ágora / CaixaForum Valencia This building by Calatrava is the home of CaixaForum Valencia, a multipurpose space that hosts temporary and permanent exhibits, live music, projections, conferences and shows for visitors to enjoy culture and science. SEE MORE L'Assut d'Or Also work of the Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava, the Assut d'Or Bridge crosses the former riverbed of the River Turia, between the Science Museum and the Ágora. There are several lanes for traffic in both directions and there is a pedestrian bridge in the centre connecting the two banks of the Turia Garden.

Once it has, it will be one of the loves of your lives. For sure. Plaza de la Virgen and the cathedral quarter Do you love history? Learn more about the origins of the Holy Grail in the heart of Valencia. Visit the ancient cathedral, feel the thrill in the Basílica de la Vírgen de los Desamparados and discover cultural treasures such as l'Almoina. Just go to Plaza de la Virgin and wander around its surroundings. Let's go! Plaza del mercado y Lonja de la Seda (Silk Exchange) Like a trip to the past where you won’t want to come back: this is how you will feel when you visit Valencia's Central Market. Located in a magnificent pre-modernist building, there are stalls serving top-quality food and a charming je ne sais quoi all around the area's markets. Just in front of the market is Lonja de la Seda, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is a must when visiting Valencia, as well as Santos Juanes Church just a few metres away. Museums Valencia is also all about art. And there are 34 museums! Culture activities are always a great idea as they make us think, feel and consider life from a different perspective. Enjoy the city's history, architecture and master pieces by famous artists from different eras, such as Goya or Sorolla at the Fine Arts Museum San Pío V. Visit the delightful National Museum of Ceramics in the Palace of Marqués de Dos Aguas. If you like contemporary art, you cannot miss out on IVAM, Centre del Carme or MUVIM.

It is joyful and full of colour, and its central fountain is surrounded by flowers and people wanting to immortalise the moment. There are majestic buildings nearby, such as Correos, a real treasure, the Estación del Norte train station, or the Town Hall itself that is the heart from which everything flows. Gunpowder and music in Fallas, a great atmosphere all year round, horchata stalls, theatres, restaurants and... lots of charm. The Valencia's Marina and beaches It is impossible to think about the city on the River Turia without mentioning the Marina and the beaches. It is a must to take a walk around the new trendy seafaring neighbourhood, El Cabanyal. A paella overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, sunbathing (luckily the sun is out almost all year round), an ice cream or a drink with friends at such a privileged place...these are just some of the cool things you can do in Valencia. Visit the port and see the 19th-century storage facilities (Tinglados), Edificio del Reloj (Clock Building) and Veles e Vents restaurant. You will love watching the sunset on one of the bar terraces. The Albufera Nature Park One of our favourite spots is only 10 kilometres away from the city: La Albufera Natural Park.

You should visit it if you want to understand the origins of Valencian cuisine. It will be magical. Will you let yourself fall in love with the area?

The old river course from the Turia River is now a large green space full of pedestrians, cyclists and people doing sports. If we go from one end to another, not only can we see true nature in an urban setting, but we can also find great monuments, such as Palau de la Música or the City of Arts and Sciences. It is a remarkable privilege! Bioparc and Oceanogràfic Visit Africa, Japan and even the Arctic without leaving Valencia. It is all possible at Bioparc and Oceanogràfic.

The Turia Park The Turia Garden is one of the largest urban parks in Spain. It runs through the city along nine kilometres of green space boasting foot paths, leisure and sports areas, and romantic spots where you can unwind. From Cabecera Park to the City of Arts and Sciences, the Turia Garden is the perfect place for runners, cyclists, families and nature enthusiasts. Crossed by 18 bridges full of history , the former riverbed passes by the city's main museums and monuments on either bank. The vast gardens are built on the former riverbed of the Turia, whose course was altered to prevent constant flooding in the city. After a devastating flood on 14 October 1957, the Turia's course was diverted south of the city, leaving a huge tract of land that crosses the city from West to East, bordering the historical centre. Several urban planners and landscapists designed different sections of the park, recreating the former river scenery. They created a unique itinerary of palm trees and orange trees, fountains and pine woods, aromatic plants and ponds, sports facilities and rose beds. The gardens were inaugurated in 1986. The Cabecera Park and Bioparc border the huge gardens to the west, and the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences border it on the opposite side, near the mouth of the river. The Turia Garden connects a realistic-looking African savannah in the Bioparc with the underwater world and ecosystems you can visit in the Oceanogràfic, and the spectacular opera auditorium and Palau de les Arts housed in the City of Arts and Sciences. There are many other interesting stops along the way. In the huge Gulliver park, children can climb onto the fingers, hair and legs of a giant, 70m recumbent figure and slide down them like Lilliputians. The Palau de la Música, which offers a complete annual programme, is nearby. Broad esplanades outside the Palau provide spaces where children can skate and play football. Small, swan-shaped boats are for hire in Cabecera Park. The ponds surrounding the City of Arts and Sciences hire out water walking balls and canoes in summer. Valencia is a flat city, so the Turia Garden is the perfect place for running enthusiasts and those who prefer to cycle on bicycles, segways and tandems. These small vehicles are for hire in the Garden. You will find many bars and cafés with extensive terraces along the way, where you can take a break for refreshment. The Turia Garden is crossed by 18 bridges from different periods and architectural styles. The most outstanding historical bridges are those of San José (17th century), Serranos (16th century), Trinidad (15th century), El Real (16th century) and El Mar (16th century). More recent bridges are the Puente de la Exposición, 9 d'Octubre, Las Flores and l'Assut d'Or, designed by Santiago Calatrava; the Las Artes bridge, next to the IVAM (Valencian Institute of Modern Art), by Norman Foster; and the Ángel Custodio bridge, by Arturo Piera. The former riverbed also links other points in Valencia not to be missed, like the Serranos Towers, a gate in the old city walls that surrounded Valencia, currently converted into a wonderful viewpoint over the historical centre and gardens; the Valencia Institute of Modern Art (IVAM) and the Museum of Fine Arts. All of these are located on the former banks of the Turia, which serve as a guide for an interesting cultural itinerary in the city of Valencia.

You won’t get enough of this Mediterranean city, with more than 2,000 years of history, green spaces, various museums, historic buildings, lively squares with terraces to enjoy the sun, not to forget the long sandy beaches... The list is long, but here’s a selection of the essential things you need to do in Valencia. It begins with a view of the historic centre and its rich artistic heritage. You can see the Holy Grail in the Cathedral; the Silk Exchange (Lonja de la seda), a jewel of civil Gothic; the Central Market , one of the most alive and appetizing in Europe; the ancient Roman ruins in the Almoina Museum , or go up to contemplate an unbeatable panoramic view of the city from the Miguelete or the Torres de Serranos . Another must see, is the City of Arts and Sciences . We recommend you to combine it with a bike ride along the old course of the River Turia . The Turia Garden crosses the entire city, with the Cabecera Park and Bioparc at one end and the City of Arts and Sciences at the other, and more than eight kilometres of gardens to cover on your walk. Also, you can’t miss enjoying a good Paella by the beach. Nine kilometres of fine sand and a stone's throw from the centre. The beaches of València are waiting for you! You have the urban beaches of El Cabañal and La Malvarrosa , in the area of Poblados Marítimos, next to the famous neighbourhood of El Cabañal. A little further north continues the beach of Patacona, and to the south follow the beaches of Pinedo, La Devesa and El Saler, in the Natural Park of L'Albufera. All of them have a blue flag, are accessible by public transport and have good restaurants to enjoy the gastronomy of the area. And if you still have time, there are many things to see in Valencia. The city has more than 30 museums for everyone, from Fine Arts to Lead Soldiers, Science and IVAM. In addition, you must have to try the authentic Valencian horchata or a good hot chocolate with churros. The Colón Market, the Plaza de la Reina or the Plaza de la Virgen have good establishments for this and are also very atmospheric and interesting places to visit in Valencia. Don't think about it anymore and visit Valencia. 26 Fri 16º 8º WHAT TO SEE IN VALÈNCIA The complete guide to València to know what to see and do in València 10 Essential places to visit 10 Essential places to visit You can visit Valencia in three days!

At the weekend, which is when there is more atmosphere, the bustle starts after dinner and can go on until the early hours of the morning because, although pubs close at 3.30am, clubs are open until 7.30am. So, if you are looking to party, this is your city (but don’t get too carried away, please). Join us for a tour from area to area to see which one suits you best!! El Carmen Right in the historic centre, the area of el Carmen is the liveliest. We recommend sitting at a terrace in Plaza Negrita, el Tossal or el Doctor Collado to spend the evening clinking glasses or walking around the back streets until you find the perfect place to have some tapas. Other typical things to do in el Carmen include drinking Agua de Valencia in Café de las Horas bar, listening to live jazz in the Jimmy Glass bar or dancing until the morning at Radio City. Ruzafa neighbourhood The area of Ruzafa, in L’Eixample, is the most alternative of the city. Here, you can mix with the most modern Valencians in restaurants like Canalla Bistró, Dos Estaciones or Nozomi Sushi Bar. Are you looking for culture? Explore the interesting alternative cultural route in Ruzafa at the Ubik book shop or the Espai Tactel gallery. If what you want is to dance, great music awaits you in the small bars or clubs such as Oven and Play. Marina de Valencia The Marina is an eclectic zone that is especially lively during the summer months. The Marina Beach Club, with a swimming pool right by the sea, is the place to be seen. The Fábrica de Hielo is a place to have a drink in a more relaxed atmosphere. If you want to let yourself go more, then the La 3 club on Avenida Blasco Ibáñez is for you. City of Arts and Science If you are looking for something more sophisticated, the City of Arts and Sciences is your place. From June to September, L’Umbracle is transformed into the most beautiful terrace in the city and, if you are looking for more of a party, you only have to go downstairs to the famous club, Mya. There are also many well-known bars on the nearby streets like 48 and On The Rocks. Other areas But nightlife in Valencia doesn’t end there. If you go to other areas of the city looking to party, you’ll find that on Thursdays the student nightlife is at Benimaclet, Plaza Xúquer, Honduras and el Cedro, and that the older audience (who still want to have a good time) often go out near Calle Juan Llorens, Avendia de Aragón or Plaza Cánovas.

Valencia is a green city, with extensive parks and gardens that fulfil this function. Here you can relax, have a picnic, do sport, or stroll among pines, poplars and orange trees. The Turia Garden , laid out in the old riverbed and now converted into a large urban park that crosses the city from west to east, is a real gem for nature lovers. Other oases in the city are the Central Park , the Cabecera Park , the Botanical Garden , the Viveros Gardens , and the Monforte Garden . Centennial holm oaks, eucalyptus, palm, mulberry and fig trees... Valencia has more than 500 monumental trees! They are all compiled and geolocated in the Valencia Green Routes APP , which offers you different routes and games to discover 400-year-old trees, the more Mediterranean specimens or other more exotic ones from different parts of the world, such as the Indian laurel, Australian oaks, Asian coconuts, a ginkgo, and even a living fossil from China.

An urban oasis surrounded by paddy fields and woods: that is what L’Albufera Natural Park means to anyone who is familiar with it. You will definitely want to pay a visit if you’d like to discover the origins of Valencian cuisine. Because what better reason to come than the fact that paella was invented right here? Head over to the town of El Palmar and try their traditional dishes. Sample some all-i-pebre (eel stew flavoured with garlic and pepper) and marinated striped mullet . You’ll experience a new way of understanding food: enjoying it while also learning its origins.

This visit also includes a boat trip. favourite card 10% off Valencia Tourist Card Bike rental to the Albufera with boat ride €38.00 Bike rental to the Albufera with boat ride favourite card -2,5 € València Tourist Card Albufera Tourist Bus €22.00 Albufera Tourist Bus The highlight: a boat ride A boat ride is the best way to see the bird life close up and relax in this fantastic natural environment. At dusk, the reddish golden hues of the sunset create a truly magical atmosphere. There are docks at Gola de Pujol and in the ports in Catarroja, Silla, Sollana and El Palmar . You will travel in a type of handcrafted boat known as an albuferenc, and the ride lasts around 40 minutes . You can also book outings that combine a boat ride with a tour of a traditional barraca (cottage), or an authentic paella, of course. Exploring the local ecosystems The main attraction is the large freshwater lagoon spanning more than 2,800 hectares, the largest in Spain, to which the park owes its name: L’ Albufera . It provides shelter for up to 300 different species of birds throughout the year, especially the waterfowl that winter there, including flamingos. In fact, L’Albufera has been designated as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, and since 1994, as a Special Protection Area (ZEPA). If you're interested in ornithology, at the Racó de l’Olla Interpretation Centre , you can learn more about the park's bird life and do some birdwatching from its observatories and the observation tower, which offers a panoramic view. You can get to this nature classroom on EMT lines 24 or 25, getting off at the Pinars - Carretera del Palmar stop. The lagoon is surrounded by a landscape of marshes and paddy fields, which are completely transformed with each phase of the agricultural cycle: green in summer, blue in winter when water floods the fields, and brown when the ground is left bare. And on the strip that separates it from the sea, you will find a unique ecosystem: the natural dunes and pine woods of La Devesa . Visit in summer to relax in the sun between the rugged vegetation and the sea, on wild beaches like L’Arbre de Gos , Devesa , El Saler and La Garrofera . Tancats , or artificial wetlands At any of the docks, you can get a boat to Tancat de la Pipa , a biodiversity reserve inside the park that is open to visitors with advance reservations. It is made up of 40 hectares of paddy field that in 2007 were turned into a group of aquatic habitats thanks to dense vegetation that functions as a powerful filter, boosting the water quality. Additionally, the former La Pipa turbine house now serves as a small visitor centre with a spectacular view of the park from the viewpoint. There are two other tancats , Mília and L'Illa , public access to which is highly restricted to protect the wildlife. If you want to visit them, send an email to tancatdemilia@albufera.bio or tancatdelilla@albufera.bio. Blasco Ibáñez, chronicler of L'Albufera No one was better able to portray life in L'Albufera than Valencian author Vicente Blasco Ibáñez . Some of his novels, including The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and Blood and Sand , were made into films starring such actors as Glenn Ford, Tyrone Power, Rita Hayworth and Rudolph Valentino. Fishing in L’Albufera During fishing season, October to April, the delightful fish market (Caudete, 13; El Palmar) offers local wild eel, as well as sea bass , striped mullet and carp. Legally recognized by King Jaume I in 1250, the Fishermen’s Association is made up of 400 members, of which 100 are still active. There are 56 established fishing areas, which are assigned by drawing lots each season in what is known as the redolin draw. The name comes from the small wooden balls into which the fishermen insert a piece of paper with their name. These are then placed in the raffle drum. As each ball emerges, the fishermen choose their fishing spots. The last one to be picked will be the pesador for the fish market, responsible for weighing all the day's catches at the market, in exchange for a percentage of sales. Their catch is offered for direct sale year-round at the market: striped mullet, eel and blue crab, in season. If you're planning on making a purchase, it is best to call the market (+34 961 620 347), ask what they have that day, place your order and then go pick it up. Opening hours are Monday to Friday, 8.00am–2.30pm, and Saturday until 1.00 pm.

Valencia,https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-see-valencia/neighbourhoods-and-areas-valencia,1,"Valencia Areas | Best areas to stay in Valencia Skip to main content EN Language selector es en nl fr de it va 0 Search button Search Submit Search Close Mobile menu expander Valencia Areas & Neighborhood System messages Close popup share whatsapp facebook twitter linkedin Neighbourhoods and areas in Valencia Discover the most charming neighbourhoods and areas in Valencia Valencia is an amazing city full of life, with a Mediterranean atmosphere and fascinating spots all over the 19 districts that are subdivided into 88 neighbourhoods. Here you can find a guide on the most notable neighbourhoods in the city, organised into 6 areas so you can plan your time and not miss out on anything. See the map with the most interesting neighbourhoods and areas to visit in Valencia so you can enjoy a complete experience in the city . Historic Centre Valencia has one of the oldest historic centres in Europe. The city has over 2000 years of profound history and a rich artistic heritage; therefore, it is a must see. Both La Lonja and the Water Tribunal, which meets every Thursday at the Cathedral's Door of the Apostles, are part of the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage Site list, as well as the local festivity, Fallas, which takes place in March. The list of essential visits in the historic centre is long, with treasures such as the Cathedral and the Holy Chalice, the Central Market, the frescoes in the Church of San Nicolás, the Torres de Serranos, Plaza Redonda or the Palace of Marqués de Dos Aguas, among others. You will need a full day to see them all. VIEW MORE Alameda, City of Arts and Oceanogràfic As it is a large area of the city, the best way to discover it all is on foot or by bike through the Turia Garden and see the 18 bridges that cross them. You can start at Alameda with the Viveros and Monforte Gardens and the Museum of Fine Arts, a spectacular classical picture gallery. Afterwards, you can then move on to the old Turia river bed, where you can visit the City of Arts and Sciences, Puente de la Exposición and Palau de la Música. We recommend you take a full day to visit all of the above, as visiting the Oceanogràfic and the rest of the City of Arts and Sciences will take approximately 5 hours. VIEW MORE The Marina, beaches and the Cabañal neighbourhood This area is ideal to enjoy Valencian cuisine with a sea breeze and spectacular views. The Valencia Marina is a famous area with plenty of space to walk, ride a bike, enjoy the local cuisine and do water sports. The Cabañal and Malvarrosa beaches, the promenade and the Cabañal seafaring neighbourhood area trendy areas due to their lifestyle. It is a large area with a varied leisure and cuisine offer, therefore we recommend you take your time when visiting it. You can go for a swim at the beach, ride a bike, try a Valencian paella and enjoy the lively atmosphere on the terraces next to the beach. VIEW MORE Albufera Natural Park The Albufera Natural Park is only 10 kilometres from the city. It is a Mediterranean ecosystem with a combination of wild dune beaches, pine forests, rice fields and a huge freshwater lake. You don't need a car to reach it, bus number 25 takes you straight there or you can take the Albufera Bus Turistic for a panoramic visit. In order to learn more about the area's biodiversity, take a boat ride on the lake's calm water or take a bike ride or stroll along one of the six marked routes in the park. Paella was invented in this area, so why not try one? You can also discover other local culinary delights, such as all-i-pebre or llisa adobada. We recommend you spend at least 6 hours on this visit in order to take a boat ride, discover a part of the park and try some of the local cuisine. VIEW MORE Bioparc and Parque de Cabecera At the other end of the Turia Garden, to the west of the city, one of the largest green areas in Valencia, Parque de Cabecera, can be found. You can visit a small part of Africa in the ecosystems recreated by Bioparc Valencia, with species and vegetation from the African savannah, forests from equatorial Africa and Madagascar, as well as wetlands. Bioparc will take 3 hours to visit. It could be longer if you walk around Parque de Cabecera or go out on a pedal boat in the lake. VIEW MORE Ensanche and Ruzafa Ensanche has a great amount of modernist architectural treasures and is the best shopping area in the city. Ruzafa is also a great area known as the Valencian ""soho"". Plan your visit and enjoy the best shops, cuisine and lively atmosphere at the Colon Market, as well as other alternative shops and galleries in the Ruzafa neighbourhood. Famous Valencian chefs have chosen this area to open resturants, such as Habitual or Canalla Bistró by Ricard Camarena, Mercatbar by Quique Dacosta or RiFF by Bernd Knöller.

Particular highlights include the Turia Gardens , the city's green lung, the Viveros and the Botanic Garden .  Added to this vast green space are almost 20 kilometres of beaches , all of which have been awarded European Blue Flag status. The Albufera Natural Park makes the perfect setting for a rural getaway exploring the country lanes criss-crossing El Saler and the adjacent rice fields. The same is true of the Huerta Valenciana, a compendium of small farmhouses, fields and farmsteads, surrounded by the green agriculture that envelops the city. Having such a well-stocked pantry on the doorstep makes it ever easier to find restaurants offering interesting organic or zero food miles cuisine. Close to 150 kilometres of cycle paths and 40 ciclocalles (cycle-priority streets) make visiting the city on two wheels an attractive option. A public transport network comprising 46 bus routes and 9 metro lines, as well as the growth of pedestrianised areas in the city, contribute to discovering Valencia from an environmentally friendly perspective.

Valencia,https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-do-valencia/valencian-culture/must-see-museums-valencia,1,"Museums of Valencia: the top 9 | Visit Valencia Skip to main content EN Language selector es en nl fr de it va 0 Search button Search Submit Search Close Mobile menu expander Valencia’s top 9 museums System messages Close popup share whatsapp facebook twitter linkedin Must-see museums for your trip to Valencia If you're an art lover, enjoy discovering a wide range of creations and adore museums, both inside and out, Valencia has some sure bets for you. Because Valencia has museums where the building itself is a work of art, housing examples of every artistic style. What’s more, they're located in essential areas of Valencia for visitors, a real plus, for sure. To help you make the (difficult) decision of which Valencia museums to visit, we've put together a varied selection of the best to give you an idea why they're worth a look, what you’ll find there and which of the city's can't miss sights you can combine them with . Off we go! Valencia’s top museums As we said, our selection includes options representing various artistic disciplines so you can choose the best one for you: painting, sculpture, ceramics and even art for the Fallas festival all await at Valencia's museums. Let’s dive in. #1 Museum of Fine Arts San Pío V, 9 We start off strong with Spain’s second largest art museum: the Museum of Fine Arts . Its current headquarters is the former Colegio Seminario de San Pío V, founded in 1683, which is located on the banks of the River Turia. The building and its surroundings are a gift for the senses in themselves. If you can, head down to the river for a stroll before or after your museum visit. What will you find inside? This Valencia museum boasts an extensive selection of paintings, sculptures, engravings and archaeological pieces dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries . If there is one thing the collection is noted for, it is paintings by such prestigious Valencian creators as Sorolla, Ribalta and the Pinazos , among other local artists who displayed great mastery of light. Not to mention works by none other than the geniuses Van Dyck , Murillo , Velázquez , El Greco and Goya . To finish this visit in style, be sure to make a stop in the Courtyard of Ambassador Vich, located inside the museum. This Renaissance cloister has been exquisitely reconstructed, and the predominant colour is an unexpected blue. Another bonus is that admission to this Valencia museum is free. It is open 10am–8pm, every day except Monday. MUseum of fine arts #2 Carme Contemporary Culture Centre Museo, 2 The Carme Contemporary Culture Centre (CCCC) is in the heart of El Carmen neighbourhood, the most colourful area of the city. What is more, it owes its name to the fact that it is housed in the former Nuestra Señora del Carmen de València Royal Monastery. This is probably the most diverse of the city's museums, mixing styles and techniques ranging from art installations to painting, along with design, literature and graffiti: there is space for everything. And this is precisely what makes it interesting. A visit to the CCCC is an active experience for all ages, as it even includes a gallery for the little ones: the Espai de Titelles, designed for children aged 0 to 3 . Take advantage of your visit to the heart of El Carmen neighbourhood to stroll along its side streets, sip a vermouth, eat at an outdoor café, admire the medieval towers and discover its mansions. When can you visit the culture centre? The centre’s opening hours are Tuesday–Sunday, 11am–9pm. Entry is free. CENTRE DEL CARME #3 Bancaja Foundation Plaza de Tetuán, 23 The Bancaja Foundation is a private not-for-profit organisation. In addition to putting together temporary exhibitions, it boasts a collection which the foundation describes as a ‘catalogue of masterpieces’. And this should come as no surprise. Its most notable pieces include prints by Picasso and Valencian artist Joaquín Sorolla, two national and international heavyweights. While you're in Valencia, check out the current exhibitions at the time of your visit . They're normally incredibly interesting . To give you an idea, its galleries have hosted exhibitions on Chillida and others devoted to industrial design, as well as shows featuring such artists as Antonio López , Julio Romero de Torres , Sorolla and Picasso , to name just a few. This Valencia museum also organises activities for all ages, including workshops, lectures and performing arts festivals, making it a truly vibrant space. The building is a stone’s throw from the historic district and Colón Street, the city's biggest shopping street, if you’d like to take the opportunity to do a bit of shopping or simply go for a walk. Valencia's centre has a range of architecture that is well worth a look. The foundation is open 10am–2pm and 4.30pm–8.30pm, Tuesday–Sunday. There are two ticket prices: general admission, which is €7, and reduced, which is €4. Children 12 and under are free. BANCAJa fundation Not to be missed The museums and monuments of Valencia Book here #4 National Museum of Ceramics Rinconada García Sanchiz, 6 Pottery and ceramics are an essential part of Valencia’s DNA, with a tradition dating back a mere 7000 years. This makes the González Martí National Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts among Valencia’s most special. It could actually be said to be two in one, as the first floor gives a very tangible glimpse into the 18th-century aristocratic lifestyle, having been completely refurbished in that century, although it was built in the 15th. Before heading up to visit the museum, pause to take in the incredible sight of the Palace of the Marquis de Dos Aguas and its baroque façade . Once inside, you can visit such galleries as the Ballroom and the Red Room, see the Carriage of the Nymphs, spectacular staircases, elaborate coffered ceilings, and the painting collection of González Martí . Can you imagine what it must have been like to live in a place like this? And then there is the pottery collection, a journey through human history. There are pieces produced by different cultures, from the Romans, Greeks and Iberians to the present day. This is why we referred to it as two museums in one. The National Ceramics Museum is located between Valencia's most commercial district and other must-see sights: the Central Market area and the Silk Exchange, a World Heritage Site. Hours are Tuesday–Saturday, 10am–2pm and 4pm–8pm; Sunday and holidays, 10am–2pm. If you're planning to visit in what’s left of 2021, admission is free. If you come after that, general admission will be €3, and reduced-price tickets will be €1.50. In any case, it's always better to check before visiting. NAtIONAL museum of ceramics #5 El Patriarca or Corpus Christi Royal School/Seminary La Nave, 1 How about the names Caravaggio , Juan de Juanes , El Greco , Morales and Ribalta , do they ring a bell? You’ll find them all and other artists of their stature at the Corpus Christi Royal School/Seminary, also known as El Patriarca . As the name indicates, the building was constructed for use as a seminary between 1586 and 1615. Buuuut, since 1959 it has also been a museum displaying the vast collection accumulated over the centuries. Once again, in addition to its contents, this is another museum whose building is a must-see in itself. If you come in through the main entrance, you will enter a double lobby leading to … that depends! If you turn to the left, you’ll see an enormous stuffed alligator . Yes, you read that right, a real alligator brought back by a mission to the Americas with a curious legend. It is posted there like a guard before the chapel. But don't let that stop you from entering, or you will miss the extremely valuable frescoes and the high altar presided over by a Last Supper by Ribalta. And on the other side of the lobby? To the right lies one of the oldest Renaissance cloisters in Spain, with a courtyard, columns and arches accompanied by a ceramic tile plinth course, not a surprising feature in Valencia . The entrance to the museum is just to the right of the courtyard. When you finish, you can stop by El Patriarca Square, right beside the complex, and stroll through such iconic streets as calle Comedias and calle de la Nave. The museum is open mornings, Monday–Sunday, 11am–1.30pm; and afternoons, Monday–Friday only, 5pm–7pm. Tickets are €5. EL PATRIARCA #6 IVAM - Valencian Institute of Modern Art Guillem de Castro, 118 Our tour of Valencia's most noteworthy museums continues, taking us a little way from the city centre to the bounds of the medieval walls of the capital on the River Turia. The IVAM is a complex devoted to modern art where you can enjoy two permanent shows dedicated to two key figures in early 20th-century art: Ignacio Pinazo and Julio González . Although its collection is unique, the IVAM’s personality cannot be understood without its temporary exhibitions, workshops, lectures, installations and events for all ages. One gets the sense that there is always something going on at the IVAM. Another of its attractions is the Wall Gallery . This space in the basement of the Julio González Centre contains the remains of the 14th-century medieval wall . There is also a restaurant with a delightful outdoor seating area. We’ll leave it at that … Where can you go after the IVAM? A few metres away, you’ll find the Quart Towers – one of the two gates in the medieval wall still standing (the other is the Serranos Towers) – leading to El Carmen neighbourhood. Opening hours for the Valencian Institute of Modern Art are Tuesday–Sunday, 10am–7pm, and Friday, 10am–9pm. General admission is €6, reduced admission is €3, and children 10 and under are free. IVAM #7 Hortensia Herrero Art Center Calle del Mar, 31 Modern, elegant, and with a very special touch, that's how this contemporary art center is described. It houses the private collection of Hortensia Herrero , patron and vice president of the foundation that bears her name. Additionally, it is located in the heart of the city, in the old Valeriola Palace , a emblematic 17th-century construction that is itself an architectural treasure. The collection includes works from over 50 contemporary artists of internationally recognized prestige. Anselm Kiefer, Anish Kapoor, George Baselitz, Mat Collishaw, Tony Cragg, Andreas Gursky, Jaume Plensa, Cristina Iglesias, Joan Miró, Antonio Saura, Julio González, or Manolo Valdés, as well as pieces created specifically for the Art Center's locations that make it even more special. Creations ranging from the avant-garde to the most innovative await you. Imagine paintings that make you question reality and sculptures that evoke emotions. A visual experience you can't miss! The center is open from Tuesday to Saturday from 10:00 to 20:00, and on Sunday from 10:00 to 14:00. Guided tours can be reserved, and entry is free on Wednesday afternoons. HORTENSIA Herrero #8 La Almoina Archaeological Museum Plaza de Décimo Junio Bruto s/n A visit to La Almoina is a journey through the city's evolution from its founding by the consul Decimus Junius Brutus and the coming of the Roman Empire, through the Visigothic period and the Muslim era until it returned to Christian hands . What can you see? If you follow the standard route for the visit, you will move in chronological order, discovering the different sections and periods. Begin at the centre of the site , where you’ll find the Roman baths and ruins of the Republic-era city . Also dating from this period are the forum portico and curia building . From the Visigoths, look for the baptistery and monumental tombs . And for the Muslim period, the alcázar (fortress), waterwheel, pool and part of the fortifications . Following all these civilisations, Jaume I reconquered the territory. The building that houses La Almoina dates from this period, a space built to provide for people with no resources . To this it owes its name. We know you must be thinking that this archaeological complex has to be huge. And so it is: 2500 m2 where you can visualise the city's history from its earliest beginnings. If you look at it that way, it doesn’t seem so large, does it? Another of the museum’s attractions is that it’s just around the corner from La Virgen Square, La Reina Square and Valencia Cathedral, an area packed with cultural and historic landmarks. The perfect place to get something to eat or sip a Valencian horchata (tiger nut milk). Opening hours are Tuesday–Saturday, 10am–7pm and Sunday and holidays, 10am–2pm. Admission is free on Sundays and holidays, and tickets are €2 the rest of the week. ALMOINA #9 Fallas Museum Plaza Monteolivete, 4 Have you ever heard of a ninot ? Let’s start there: ninots are each of the satirical figures that make up the fallas (sculptures) displayed during the annual Fallas festival. As you may know, every March, Valencia celebrates its greatest festival: Las Fallas. The culmination of the celebration is the burning of the artistic constructions that crowd the streets in preceding days, structures built over the course of the entire year. However, since 1934, two ninots chosen by popular vote have been saved from being burnt , which have been called ninots indultats and are exhibited in this very Valencian museum. In addition to presenting these representatives of Las Fallas, the museum shows how they have been made since the early days (we’ll share the secret: they were made of wax), the techniques used to set up the fallas , and posters and photographs from the history of this festival, which has been on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list since 2016 . While the best option is of course to experience Las Fallas during the week of the event itself, if you can't visit in March, the Fallas Museum is a great way to discover this unique tradition, which is sometimes difficult to grasp if you don’t see it in person. What sights can you combine with a visit to the Fallas Museum? Without a doubt, a stroll through the stretch of Turia Gardens between El Reino Bridge (the one with the gargoyles) and the City of Arts and Sciences should definitely be part of the plan when you visit this Valencia museum. Walking under the bridges surrounded by gardens, parks and the occasional snack bar where you can refuel will do you a world of good. The museum is open from Tuesday to Saturday from 10am to 7pm (last admission to the museum at 6pm) and from 10am to 2pm (last admission to the museum at 1pm) on Sundays and public holidays. Admission is €2, except on Sundays and public holidays, when it is free. fallas museum And so, we have come to the end of our journey through Valencia’s absolutely can’t miss museums. As the saying goes, ‘not all are here, nor are there here all those that are’. However, if you visit them all, you can proclaim loud and clear that you are indeed truly familiar with Valencia and its culture. And if this list has only whetted your appetite, take a look at all the other museums Valencia has to offer.

Valencia,https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-see-valencia/historical-centre/del-carmen-neighborhood,1,"Barrio del Carmen | Valencia Skip to main content EN Language selector es en nl fr de it va 0 Search button Search Submit Search Close Mobile menu expander El Carmen neighborhood in Valencia System messages Close popup share whatsapp facebook twitter linkedin El Carmen neighborhood: a cocktail of history and leisure The district of El Carmen , located at the northwest end of the historic center, is the best known of Valencia's neighborhoods. It takes its name from the church and convent of Carmen Calzado, and is rightly renowned as a utopia for lovers of Mediterranean cuisine and leisure. Although the range of restaurants and venues is unparalleled, this neighborhood is much more than that. It's an area of Ciutat Vella with a thousand years of history and magnificent examples of medieval architecture , a rich artistic heritage, hundreds of historical anecdotes and the origin of a good number of local legends. Because the Barrio del Carmen is the perfect combination of history and leisure. Its history. Home of the strangest guilds In the 11th century , with the Arab wall recently completed, an area that remained outside this structure would gradually gain in agricultural activity. Houses would be built alongside the few existing farmsteads. Being outside the wall explains why today, it is the place where the remains of the Islamic fortification are most visible, since the area developed behind it, preserving it and integrating it into its buildings. Such is the case of the section of wall and tower found in the vicinity of the squares of the Angel and Los Navarros , as well as Calle de la Cruz . Or inside the Montaner bakery . Remains of the Arab wall Once James I conquered the city, the king distributed some of the dwellings in that part of the city among his troops. The area would be entirely under the protection of the expanded Christian wall built in the 14th century . After that, it became a refuge for a large part of the medieval guilds, some of which involved curious occupations. Els blanquers (tanners) gave the name to the area of Blanqueries , els caputxers were tasked with making the hoods used at times of mourning, but only els corredors d’orella were dedicated to proclaiming the announcement of the Virgin. Els velluters (velvet weavers) were crucially important, given the countless looms that populated Valencia and gave rise to the Colegio Mayor de la Seda , an institution that you can learn about by visiting the Museo de la Seda (Silk Museum). Then there were the els traginers (mule drivers), who transported goods and dead people in their carts (the plague was wreaking havoc), while els cegos oracioners (also called the paternosters) were blind people who sang songs to the rhythm of their guitars and vihuelas. What a horde! They no doubt helped give the neighborhood a roguish feel. Silk Museum Loom Explore its architectural and cultural heritage The neighborhood preserves some of the city’s best museums and a few architectural jewels. One such jewel is known as Portal de la Valldigna , an ancient entrance to the Moorish quarter, where all the Muslims lived after James I took back the city. Portal de la Valldigna The Church of San Nicolás de Bari and San Pedro Mártir has become a must-see in Valencia ever since its impressive mural paintings in the vault, regarded as Valencia's Sistine Chapel , were restored. Church of San Nicolás de Bari and San Pedro Mártir The former Convento del Carmen, from which the neighborhood gets its name, has been transformed into the Centre del Carme Cultura Contemporània , a modern museum. Also at the cutting edge is the prestigious Institut Valencià d'Art Modern (IVAM) . La Beneficencia, with its magnificent collections of ethnographic and prehistoric items, rounds out the trio of large exhibit centers. How ironic that an ancient area like this would become home to the best modern art that Valencia has to offer. Museo del Carmen A soothing visit has to include a couple of buildings in the very nearby Mercat district. The building of the Lonja de la Seda (Silk Exchange), a unique example of Gothic civic style and named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, captivates visitors with the spectacular helical columns of its Contract Hall and the gargoyles and figures on its façade. Lonja de la Seda/Silk Exchange Another point of interest is the Central Market , a great temple for local products that features modernist decorations and is considered the great showcase for fresh food in Europe. Central Market El Carmen is also home to the only two access gates to the medieval city that are still standing: Serranos and Quart . They used to close when the bells announced night fall. And anyone who lost track of time had no choice but to sleep ""under the Valencia moon"". Serranos Towers Did you know that the Holy Grail is located in the Cathedral of Valencia ? And that it also houses one of the most important paintings of the first Spanish Renaissance? And that its Cathedral Museum is home to paintings by Maella and Goya? A climb up the Miguelete and learning the history of the Virgin of the Good Birth are other curiosities that are worth your time. Plaza de la Virgen Guided tours Discover the real Valencia Book here A series of plazas to enjoy In addition, the El Carmen neighborhood, like the complex of Ciutat Vella, offers a series of plazas that are well worth visiting and enjoying. Manises is home to the seat of Valencia's regional government, the Palau de la Generalitat , a medieval building of late Gothic style, although heavily modified over the centuries. Palau de la Generalitat Adjacent to it is the Plaza de la Virgen, which is home to the Cathedral, the Basilica of the Virgen de los Desamparados and one of the façades and the charming garden of the Palau de la Generalitat. Crossing it will take you to the Archeological Center of l'Almoina, ground zero for the city and its origins. Plaza de la Virgen A stone's throw from here is the Plaza de la Reina, site of the Baroque, or iron, façade of the Cathedral and the famous bell tower or Micalet , and from which you can see the bell tower of the Church of Santa Catalina . Plaza de la Reina The back of this church provides access to one of the most unique spaces in Valencia: the Plaza Redonda . It is a setting that houses a wide range of gift shops and restaurants. Plaza redonda Be sure to drop by the Plaza del Mercado , and the Plaza del Doctor Collado , behind the Silk Exchange , which are always very lively. But to really experience Valencia's nightlife to the fullest, there's no place like the Plaza del Tossal . Enjoy these squares on a lively walk or on their sunny terraces. Plaza del Mercado Curiosities and other surprises El Carmen is an inexhaustible source of curious places to explore. Like L’Iber , the most renowned museum of historical miniatures in the world, with more than 95,000 lead soldiers and different pieces on display. The House of Rocas , seat of the floats that represent monsters and mythological beings that are taken out on procession during the Corpus Christi celebrations. Or the House of Cats , a miniature home for kids at number 9 calle Museo. It features all kinds of details, like curtains behind the windows, main entrance, the fountain opposite the door... Next to this curious little house, a sign written on a tile recalls the height reached by the overflowing waters of the Turia River in October 1957 during the great flood. The streets of El Carmen, one of the most affected neighborhoods, are full of similar reminders. Casa de los Gatos Also worth a visit are the air raid shelters of the Spanish Civil War , during which Valencia was the capital of the 2nd Republic for almost a year. They are located at number 25 calle Serrans and number 37 calle Alta. Air raid shelter on calle Alta And don't forget to enjoy the street art events you'll find along the way, like on calle de los colores (calle de Moret), a large open-air urban art gallery. While you're there, be sure to look for the atzucacs (from the Arabic az-zuqâq, cul-de-sacs), typical of the patchwork of narrow streets that you are walking through. Here are some clues: the back of the restaurant L'Atzucac (Baix, 42) takes you to one. Calle Cañete is another. You can find the rest. Calle de los colores Shops and food for all tastes A thousand years of history makes for a long visit. Maybe it's time to buy some presents before you think about eating. There are some curious shops here, starting at the Mercado de Tapinería (Tapestry Market), which combines local crafts and fashion with some food stalls. But if you're really hungry, then it’s a matter of visiting the Mossen Sorell Market , with local food and some places where you can enjoy a good vermouth. Mercado de Tapinería The first step to whet your appetite and then satisfy your hunger is in the fine restaurants found in this area. Variety and quality. Here are a few examples: La Cigrona (Calle Serranos, 22). Typical local cuisine featuring rice and other quality Mediterranean dishes. View more La Cigrona San Tommaso (Corretgería, 39). Authentic Italian cuisine in Valencia: pizzas, fresh homemade pasta and other delicious foods from the Alpine country. View more San Tommaso Evenings and nights in El Carmen There is no better way to end the visit to the Barrio del Carmen than enjoying its exuberant leisure activities. El Carmen has become the nerve center of Valencia's nightlife. After the flood of 1957, the neighborhood went into decline, but a couple of decades later it began to spring back to life with the opening of pubs and entertainment venues. Undoubtedly, the young people of the time felt drawn to it by its age-old character. The demands of its residents and the repurposing of the old, semi-abandoned palaces as headquarters for official institutions helped to consolidate its rebirth. Barrio del Carmen Today, it is a hub in the city in terms of the range of cafes, bars and other places to enjoy the good life. Many of them are located on Calle Roteros, Calle Baja or in the vicinity of Plaza del Tossal . They come in all styles. Like the traditional Café Negrito (Plaza del Negrito, 1), where you can enjoy mojitos and other cocktails. Ghecko (Plaza del Negrito, 2) opens later, since it's more about the nightlife. Plaza del mercado You like jazz? Don't miss Jimmy Glass Jazz (Baja, 28), a prestigious venue with an international reputation. If you prefer psychedelia and funk, then Gong is your thing (Concordia, 3). For rock and good concerts, Peter Rock (Quart, 26) is the place to go. And if you like culture served with good live music, there's the classic Radio City (Santa Teresa, 19). Únic Daily Goodness (Plaza Sant Jaume, 1) offers eclecticism and a fusion of trends. As you can see, diversity and excitement reign supreme in the heart of Ciutat Vella. This is the Barrio del Carmen, a hotbed of attractions, a blend of history, heritage, survival and nightlife.

Strolling around is one of the best ways to discover the different spots of Valencia. However, for longer journeys, to visit the beaches, l'Albufera or to get to a different area, the ideal way is to choose sustainable transport. Public transport like the metro or bus , rented bicycles or a shared electric vehicle are all at your disposal in Valencia. Get around quickly, comfortably, and emissions-free! Choose public transport with the Valencia Tourist Card If you are reading this page, you are probably already aware of the benefits of public transport. Each passenger takes up much less space and emits approximately 70% less carbon dioxide than they do in a private vehicle. Well, in Valencia we make it easy for you. With the Valencia Tourist Card you have unlimited trips on the bus, metro, and tram. Get around the city, visit the beaches or l'Albufera and travel to the airport in the cheapest and most sustainable way. Velencia Tourist Card Discover Valencia by pedal power Owing to its climate and practically flat terrain, Valencia is an ideal city for getting around by bicycle. It has more than 200 kilometres of cycle lanes , the old riverbed that has been converted into the Turia Garden , which crosses it from west to east, and numerous other routes to enjoy the city and its surrounding areas with the minimum environmental impact.

This distinction, awarded by the European Commission, recognizes the city's efforts to improve the environment and the quality of life of its residents and visitors alike. It takes into account factors such as the numerous green spaces and sustainable mobility initiatives that can be enjoyed in the city, and that we invite you to discover on your visit. 26 Fri 16º 8º Green Routes DISCOVER THEM GREEN CAPITAL EVENTS A green city You can feel Valencia's green credentials as soon as you arrive. You just have to see the number of gardens and green spaces where you can escape from the urban bustle and enjoy nature without leaving the city... almost five million square meters of green areas ! We won't ask you to visit them all, but some you really should see. Start with the Jardín del Turia , an impressive nine-kilometer route of gardens and sports and leisure spaces that crosses the city where the Turia River once flowed. Then explore hidden spots for a romantic stroll, such as the Jardín de Monforte, or new esplanades recently added to the urban landscape, such as the Parque Central, with more than 100,000 square meters of land. Valencia is home to gardens for all tastes. Choose your favorite! Turia Garden Valencia Turia Garden Valencia Parks and Gardens Parks and Gardens Route of the monumental trees Route of the monumental trees Parque Central Parque Central A city with two natural parks Valencia not only has multiple green spaces in the urban center, but also two natural parks on its periphery that are easily accessible by public transportation or bicycle. The Parque Natural de l’Albufera is a veritable oasis just half an hour away from the city, not only for people but also for the thousands of birds that frequent its important wetlands every year. You can explore its different ecosystems on foot or by bike, or on a relaxing boat ride, and top it all off with a traditional Valencian paella among the rice fields that gave birth to this dish. Going up the course of the Turia River you will find the Turia Natural Park , more than 8,000 hectares of Mediterranean forest, which you can explore on foot, by bike or on horseback. In the warmer months, it is the ideal space to take shelter in the shade of the pines or take a dip in its natural pools. If you want to dive even deeper into the nature of the province, a short distance away you will find true natural paradises , such as the small villages that make up two Biosphere Reserves, or Starlight destinations from which to contemplate the universe with no light pollution.

Surrounding the city are 120 km2 of fertile vegetable and fruit farms whose produce is not only exported, but supplied to local markets and restaurants. You are guaranteed to enjoy authentic local cuisine in Valencian restaurants, with seasonal products that have barely any environmental footprint. It's one of the reasons the city was named Capital of Sustainable Urban Food in 2017. In addition to tasting delicious dishes in its restaurants, be sure to visit the Mercado Central or one of the other municipal markets in Valencia to get the freshest products, whether as a snack on the spot or to take home.

With over 200 kilometers of bike lanes and practically flat terrain, riding on two wheels through the city is a pleasure, and the most sustainable way to get to all its landmarks. If you don't like pedaling, you can also enjoy 94 km2 of pedestrian areas , including the new spaces in Plaza de la Reina, Plaza del Ayuntamiento and Plaza de Brujas, between the Mercado Central and La Lonja.

Introduction VisitCopenhagen.com and the connected social media channels under the same brand are owned and run by Wonderful Copenhagen, the official tourist organization in the Copenhagen region. All content on VisitCopenhagen and its social media channels is editorial, chosen and written by our editorial staff in alignment with Wonderful Copenhagen’s strategy and VisitCopenhagen’s communication strategy. Our main focus is to fulfil the travellers’ needs for the benefit of the destination. Strategic reason VisitCopenhagen’s communication strategy is founded on principles supporting sustainable tourism and attracting people from abroad who share the same mindset. The three main pillars of this effort are seasonal spread , geographical spread, and sustainable behaviour . On top of that, our storytelling is built around four strengths that make Copenhagen stand out, are difficult to copy for competing destinations, and that guests find attractive. Our four themes are gastronomy , outdoor city life , architecture and design , and culture and art . According to this, at least one or more of these defined strengths must be present in each component of the overall narrative we built around Copenhagen as a travel destination. Editorial freedom and independence VisitCopenhagen is run on the principle of editorial freedom. We are not paid to put certain content on the site.

But just like in any other city, you should take certain precautions. Safety in general In addition to following the official travel guidelines of your own national authorities, you can consult Danish Police here . Christiania The area is loved by many but has been a turning point for strong debate due to illegal drug dealings, which have also been subject to safety concerns for visitors. The community and authorities have worked together to improve safety and address criminal activities. (Danish legislation prohibits the dealing, buying, and possessing of illegal substances). On April 6, 2024, the residents of Christiania took a significant step by digging up the cobblestones on “Pusher Street”. This act was a symbolic gesture to mark the end of the open drug market in the area. It is advised not to search out Christiania for any sort of illegal substances. Pickpockets love distractions Photo : Thomas Rousing Around Copenhagen Central Station you should pay extra attention to pickpockets. The area around City Hall Square and the beginning of Strøget (the pedestrian street) is very busy, and also an area to be aware of thieves. Each summer, Copenhagen Municipality, in collaboration with Copenhagen Police, run a campaign warning against pickpockets. They use a variety of distractions and tactics to relieve victims of their personal items. Please ask yourself the following questions: Are you aware of your valuables in a crowd? Are your phone and money safely stored? When you pay with a card, do you always cover your pin code? Crowded areas Strøget , City Hall Square and Gothersgade can be crowded areas by night – especially during weekends. Fake police On a few rare occasions, tourists have been scammed by fake police officers. The victims have either paid on-the-spot fines for ""breaking the law"" or have been frisked and unknowingly robbed. If contacted by a police officer, demand to see legit identification. You can always contact the police by calling 114. In case of urgent matters, call 112. Looking for more inspiration for your trip? Check out these guides.

What's the winter weather like in Copenhagen? What's the weather like in Copenhagen? The climate in Copenhagen follows the four seasons of the northern hemisphere, but temperatures can vary considerably during the year. February is generally the coldest with an average of 2 degrees Celcius and 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately, snow is not something we can guarantee each winter. When it occurs, it’s typically from December until spring, but snow rarely lasts long. Temperatures in Copenhagen The average winter temperatures in Celcius in Copenhagen are (month: day / night): Dec: 3,7 / -0,5 Jan: 1,9 / -2,0 Feb: 2,0 / -2,4 Month: day / night (average temperatures in Fahrenheit): Dec: 38,7 / 31,1 Jan: 35,4 / 28,4 Feb: 35,6 / 27,7 What to wear in Copenhagen in winter? There is no bad weather, only bad clothing. In Denmark, we have a saying: ""There is no bad weather, only bad clothing."" This couldn’t be more true in winter. While temperatures may not look extreme on paper, the high humidity and biting westerly and northerly winds can make it feel much colder. Without the right clothing, exploring Copenhagen during winter can quickly become an uncomfortable experience. Layers is the key The key to staying comfortable is layering. Start with a good cotton or wool base layer that fits snugly to your body. Add a thicker, slightly looser wool sweater or fleece for insulation, and top it off with a high-quality jacket that’s both waterproof and windproof. Pair this with long underwear, a cozy beanie, and you’ll be ready to enjoy hours outdoors in the beautiful winter scenery of Copenhagen. Why wool? As you might have noticed, there’s a recurring theme here: wool. For generations, it has been a trusted material in the Nordic region—and for good reason. Wool naturally regulates temperature, keeping you warm in winter and cool in summer, making it the perfect thermal material. Plus, a classic Nordic wool jumper isn’t just practical—it looks fantastic too. Embrace the local style and wrap yourself head to toe in wool for both comfort and charm. What's open in the winter in Copenhagen? Restaurants, museums and shops are all open all year round, in winter you're just more likely to bump into a local than another tourist. Outdoor experiences, like canal cruises, also operate year-round, though some operate with fewer boats in the winter season, so keep that in mind. Tivoli is one exception. In winter, it’s usually open only for Christmas, from mid-November to the end of December, and then remains closed until reopening for Easter in April. Looking for more information on all seasons?

Back Country walks plus top pubs in Greater Manchester By Visit Manchester on Jun. 11, 2021 4 min read by Polly Checkland Manchester’s connectedness to the wider countryside is one of the city’s best assets. Numerous walks with stunning views are reachable by a direct train ride from the city centre; better still, these routes are easily paired with some of the region’s best pubs. Picture this: a morning walking through woodland and perfumed heather before arriving, properly hungry, at a traditional boozer. Open fires in the winter, beer gardens in summer, and an impressive menu year-round – it’s the ideal formula for a restorative weekend, which is why we’ve put together this guide to country walks plus some of Greater Manchester’s top pubs. Marsden Moor and The Riverhead Brewery Tap The village of Marsden in the South Pennines is a half hour train from the city centre, and the starting point for walks skirting the beautiful Butterley Reservoir, the flat tops of the moors or up Deer Hill. The National Trust has maps for a selection of great routes , also outlining time, distance and difficulty; whichever you choose, we recommend ending up at The Riverhead Brewery Tap back in Marsden, where pints and traditional food are served next to the River Colne. Tegg’s Nose, Macclesfield Forest and RedWillow Combine a climb up Tegg’s Nose and a ramble around Macclesfield Forest with a pint at RedWillow , before catching a 21 minute train from Macclesfield station if you’re heading back to the city centre. Chinley Churn and The Old Hall Inn Chinley Among the various routes that radiate out from Chinley, only a 34 minute train from Manchester Piccadilly, is a loop that scales Chinley Churn for views across to Kinder Scout and the Peak District (on clear days) before returning to the village. Award-winning local ale house The Old Hall Inn is your reward, where an excellent menu is served in a quintessential country pub; sister inn The Paper Mill , which dishes out enviable pizzas, is opposite. Quarry Bank + The Ship, Styal National Trust property Quarry Bank is brilliant for short walks – particularly when proper local pub The Ship is only a 13 minute walk away. Both are reachable from Manchester by trains to Styal station. New Mills and The Shrub Club New Mills in the High Peak is a rightfully popular starting point for walkers: serviced by two train lines (New Mills Central and Newtown) the village stands above a rocky gorge known as The Torrs. A steep descent leads to the Torrs Riverside Park, a peaceful path that links the Sett Valley Trail with the Goyt Way and Midshires Way via the dramatic arch of the Millennium Walkway. Reachable from here is the Torr Vale Mill, where cocktail bar with unbeatable views The Shrub Club is located. Dunham Massey and the Swan with Two Nicks It’s a classic combination: explore Dunham Massey ’s deer park before climbing over the Little Bollington stile and following a path through fields to The Swan with Two Nicks . The exposed beams and log fires in this rustic country pub have featured in TV programmes including Cold Feet and Coronation Street, while the comforting menu has long sated tired walkers. The Parkers Arms, Clitheroe loop There are few nicer things than a stay or visit to The Parkers Arms near Clitheroe – especially if you whet your appetite for the outstanding food here on this 5 mile circular hike . Etherow Country Park and Libby’s Bread and Wine Our next pick is less of a pub, more of a restaurant – but pairing a walk around the wooded paths of Etherow Country Park with a meal at riverside spot Libby’s Bread and Wine is hard to beat. Catch the train to and from Marple station, and make your way through Brabyns Park for an off-road route to the nature reserve and lake. The Pack Horse and Kinder Reservoir Another National Trust route, this walk begins at Bowden, with Hayfield and its much-lauded pub The Pack Horse part way around a loop that circles Kinder Reservoir. Alternatively, make Hayfield your start and end point if you’d rather not contemplate hiking with a full stomach. Sowerby Bridge to The Moorcock Inn For a short and to the point route to The Moorcock Inn , dubbed ‘head-spinningly good’ by Jay Rayner in the Guardian, follow Google maps for 40 minutes from Sowerby Bridge station, up steep inclines with admittedly stunning views. The food and wine are so good here, you might want to catch a taxi back... Hebden Bridge to Heptonstall and the Fox & Goose A circular hike from Hebden Bridge (around half an hour by train from Manchester) up to hillside village and Sylvia Plath’s burial place Heptonstall should, by all rights, end at much-loved community pub the Fox & Goose . Pick a route on the stone paths through Eaves Wood, and enjoy a pint, vegan pasty and game of darts on your return. Ramsbottom circular and the Eagle and Child Finally, follow this circular walk from Ramsbottom for spectacular views from Peel Tower, a monument to Robert Peel, before putting your feet up at award-winning pub the Eagle and Child .

Back The story behind the Manchester bee – and why it’s used everywhere in the city By Visit Manchester on Mar. 20, 2020 6 min read By Anne Beswick There are bees all over Manchester, swarms of those sweetest and busiest of insects are everywhere. Even in the depths of winter they are here, on every bollard and bench, on buildings and bins all over our city. The bee is the symbol of Manchester and this city of industry is rightly proud of its link with the hard-working insect. In 1842, the early city fathers had to decide on a coat of arms that would tell the world who we were. It was a Victorian branding exercise. They included a globe with seven bees to show how we worked and traded across the seven seas. The Manchester bee was born of industry. Manchester’s bee is a worker bee, reflecting a city made by the workers; made by the people, not a city that has grown from royal patronage or easy natural resources. Mancunians have worked hard to make this place thrive. The standard bee on our street furniture has been around since the 1970s but most of our bees are 19 th century creations. Bee-spotting is a good way to spend time in the city. When you’re strolling the streets, look up, look around and you’ll see them everywhere. On the coat of arms on the exterior of Manchester Town Hall - which is currently undertaking a large refurbishment to lovingly return it to its 1868 splendour - you will find the busy worker bees proudly displayed. You’ll see lots of references to cotton on the building, and cotton was the industry that made Manchester rich, the city’s equivalent of honey. More bees can be found at Spring Gardens, Hotel Gotham and Zizzi in King Street has a fine traditional beehive in the window that you can view whilst walking past. There is Beehive mill in Ancoats, and St Ann’s Square has oversized 1980s bees opposite the Royal Exchange . Stroll down to the Kimpton Clocktower on Oxford Road and look way up, at the clock face where bees tell the quarter hours. The ancient-and-modern University of Manchester also has three large bee symbols on its coat of arms. Manchester claimed the bee because she is an industrious little grafter, individually insignificant but collectively a superorganism. Together we are stronger. And bees are amazing; jaw-droppingly stunning. An individual worker bee lives for about three weeks in the busiest summer months. She visits between 50 to 100 flowers on each flight and up to 2,000 flowers daily. As well as producing honey she makes beeswax, propolis (a sort of disinfectant that is plastered around the entrance to the hive) and royal jelly to feed the queen. Worker bees are all female whilst the males are called drones. The latter are useful for one thing then they are thrown out of the hive and the females get on with all the work.  Please consider this and draw your own conclusions. Just remember that Manchester is well-known for its strong women! Emmeline Pankhurst, Enriqueta Rylands, Dame Nancy Rothwell, Maxine Peake, to name a few. The special thing about the human relationship with bees is that we can control them and exploit their products. Honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) are the only insects that have been domesticated and have been since at least the days of the ancient Egyptians. Jars of honey were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The Old English custom of “telling the bees” reflects the close bond between beekeeper and bee-kept. This commands that all major family issues (births, marriages and deaths but general gossip too) must be reported to the bees or they will fly off, die, or fail to produce honey. This could be seen as a quaint old custom or just a way of encouraging that proper attention is paid to the hive. And Manchester did not always pay good attention to her adopted insects. One thing we are not so proud of hereabouts is that we practically invented air pollution or, at least, the Industrial Revolution left us with a legacy of biological degradation second to none. We have spent many years rebuilding our environment and connecting back with the wider world around us and this means that our bees are back! There are beehives all around the city, on top of the Cathedral , the Printworks , Manchester Art Gallery , Manchester Central conference centre and even on some commercial buildings around the city. These bees are lovingly tended to by volunteers with an evangelical zeal for their new charges. Come the warmer days of spring and summer, real honeybees flit above our heads, busy as Mancunians. Proper Manchester honey can even be bought in some of the associated buildings and their shops. The Manchester and District beekeepers Association (mdbka.com) has its home at Heaton Park just north of the city where you can see a demonstration hive and get lots of information and advice if you wish to give beekeeping a go. We can all help the bees. Even if you don’t think that baggy combination of white canvas and netting is quite your look you can do your bit by putting out food for bees. They need flowers; simple, open flowers from spring to autumn. They like native and exotic species equally; bees aren’t prejudiced, as long as there is nectar, pollen and easy access. You can be part of this and grow your own bee-friendly flowers. In the Spring, bees love; rosemary, pussy willow, bluebell, primrose, and Hawthorne. Mid-summer calls for other plants such as; foxglove, honeysuckle, sage, clover, geranium, teasel, and thyme; and bee-friendly plants that grow in late Summer/Autumn include; buddleia, heather, lavender, marjoram, sedum, and Ivy. In Manchester, flowers are coming back too. Planters are dotted about, flowering green walls appearing, gardens are springing up in previously unlikely spaces and sympathetic apartment dwellers are planting windowsills and balconies and welcoming the bees. Local people are working together to blur the division between urban and rural and the bees are back. Manchester is back too. After many mid-twentieth century years in the doldrums, this city is on a rapid ascent. As well as all the business, sport, culture and conferences, tourists are coming in ever-larger numbers. Before the Industrial Revolution bees made honey and people loved it.  Industry turned the world upside down forever. Manchester, the original, modern city was born. Now the city is growing up and linking back to the best bits of the past.  Welcome home bees.

Back Best Boxing Day Walks in Greater Manchester By Visit Manchester on Dec. 11, 2025 9 min read Once the last mince pie has mysteriously vanished and the festive films start repeating themselves, a Boxing Day walk can be the perfect excuse to get out into the fresh air. Whether you’re looking for gentle, accessible routes around Greater Manchester, something scenic to clear the post-Christmas cobwebs, or a proper stretch of the legs after a hearty dinner, Manchester and its surrounding boroughs have no shortage of options. From peaceful reservoir paths in Stockport and Oldham to winter wanders in Salford and Trafford, it’s a brilliant time to explore the region at your own pace. Think crisp air, wide views, and enough space for everyone - families, buggies, dogs, and anyone who simply fancies a relaxed stroll. Explore Greater Manchester Grab your friends and family, hop on a train, tram or into the car, and see what Greater Manchester and its neighbouring towns have to offer. Whether you want a tougher route or an easy lakeside walk, there’s plenty to discover this season. Here's our top picks this Boxing Day: 1. Bolton: Turton and Entwistle Reservoir and Winter Hill Bolton offers some great scenic, peaceful walks this time of the year. If you're after a circular trail that's flat the whole way around, you'll enjoy Turton and Entwistle Reservoir, but if you're looking for a challenge, head to Winter Hill. The climb might leave you a little out of breath, but the views are worth every step. On a clear day, you can see right across the Northwest, and sometimes even catch a glimpse of the snowy Welsh mountains in the distance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Independent Lancashire (@independentlancashire) 2. Bury: Peel Tower and Nuttall Park Peel Tower, Holcombe Moor and Ramsbottom is a local favourite, and it’s easy to see why. The path up to Peel Tower is short but rewarding, and the view from the top is stunning on a crisp winter morning. You can even see the Manchester skylines from up there! Afterwards, wander down into Ramsbottom for a well-earned hot chocolate or coffee. Nuttall Park is another local favourite, perfect for the little ones and an easy, flat route the whole way around. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Martin Howard (@martin.howard.photo) 3. Manchester: Heaton Park and Castlefield You don’t have to leave the city to find a bit of winter peace. Heaton Park is lovely this time of year, with frosted trees, quiet paths, and views looking out to the city. It’s a great spot for a slow walk with family, friends, or your four-legged companion. If you’re looking for a more urban walk this winter, then the Castlefield neighbourhood is a must-visit! Castlefield, located at the south-west end of Deansgate, is the industrial and Roman heart of Manchester. It is home to a Roman fort, networks of canals, old mills, cosy pubs like The Wharf and restaurants. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 4. Tameside: GM Ringway, Werneth Low Country Park and Stalybridge Country Park The GM Ringway Walking Trail runs through riversides, moorlands, and pretty market towns, making Tameside a great place to explore a stretch of the route. It’s a mix of open views and cosy corners with plenty of cafes and local pubs to stop in along the way. Werneth Low Country Park is a local favourite hillside park offering some of the best panoramic views in the area, looking out over Manchester and the Pennines. It’s popular for a leisurely stroll and gorgeous for watching the sunset, even in winter. You may also want to explore Stalybridge and its independent scene. A popular walk is Stalybridge Country Park, where you can enjoy a large stretch of moorland, woodland and reservoirs above Stalybridge. Ideal for a Boxing Day natter, spotting wildlife and taking in scenic views across the Tame Valley. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Roberts (@sarahr_instasnaps) 5. Oldham: Dovestone Reservoir Set on the edge of the Peak District, Dovestone Reservoir looks especially beautiful in winter. It’s a rather challenging walk if you decide to go up into the hills, but equally rewards you with scenic views on a clear day. If you're just planning to walk around the reservoir, it's a relatively easy, flat walk. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Matt Cooke (@_matt_cooke) 6. Rochdale: Hollingworth Lake Hollingworth Lake is a classic spot for a winter walk. It’s a flat path with lovely views, and there’s always a good chance of spotting some wildlife along the water’s edge. When you’re done, grab a warm drink in one of the lakeside cafes. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 7. Salford: Worsley Village With its canal paths and timber-framed cottages, Worsley Village feels like it was made for winter. It’s calm, pretty, and full of charm – the kind of place that looks like it belongs on a Christmas card. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 8. Stockport: Bramall Hall and Park and Alderley Edge Bramall Hall is a hidden gem tucked away in Stockport . It’s a beautiful old manor house surrounded by parkland and perfect for a winter’s walk. After exploring its history, be sure to stop by the café for something warm and sweet. Just a short car or train ride outside of Manchester, you'll find Alderley Edge. Alderley Edge is beautiful in winter, with easy countryside walks and a viewpoint that offers great views across Cheshire. The village has a cosy, charming feel that really does make you feel like you’ve stepped into The Holiday . View this post on Instagram A post shared by thebubbleroom (@thebubbleroom) 9. Trafford: Dunham Massey Few places capture the season quite like Dunham Massey . Deer wander quietly through the frosty grass and the old estate looks something out of a Christmas film. If you can, visit around dusk, it feels like you’ve stepped into another world. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dunham Massey National Trust (@ntdunhammassey) 10. Wigan: Pennington Flash and Haigh Hall and Woodland Park If you’re after a lakeside walk, Pennington Flash is the place to go. The lakeside paths are wide and open, and there’s always plenty of birdlife to spot. It’s one of those places that makes you instantly relax. Another popular winter walk is Haigh Hall and Woodland Park . The trails wind through woodland and open spaces, and there’s a lake and historic Haigh Hall to see along the way. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Greg S Knight (@its.a.lumix.moment) 11. The Peaks, Cheshire & Derbyshire If you’re happy to venture a little beyond the city, the Peak District and the rolling landscapes of Cheshire and Derbyshire offer some of the best winter walking in the country. You’ll find everything from short, easy circular trails with big views to iconic hilltops and moorland routes that feel surprisingly wild for somewhere so close to Manchester. Here's our top 4 picks: For something dramatic but doable, Mam Tor ’s circular path is a favourite - a steady climb with huge panoramas and a route that’s usually manageable even in winter conditions. If you prefer something with a touch of mystery, Lud’s Church is a brilliant choice: a deep, moss-covered chasm tucked into the forest near Gradbach, perfect for a slow, atmospheric wander. Tegg’s Nose Country Park near Macclesfield is another crowd-pleaser, offering a mix of rugged old quarries, woodland, and gentle trails. Over in Glossop and the Dark Peak, there are moorland walks that feel wonderfully remote, while places like Castleton, Buxton and Rowarth make lovely bases for shorter, scenic loops followed by a warm drink in a village café. Wherever you go, you’ll find options for all abilities, from easy family-friendly paths to more invigorating routes if you’re in the mood to walk off your Christmas dinner. Whether you stay local or head a little further into the hills, a Boxing Day walk is a simple, refreshing way to round off the holiday. Manchester’s mix of accessible paths, peaceful reservoirs, forest trails and nearby Peak District gems means there’s a route for every tempo - slow, steady, or spirited. Wrap up warm, bring a flask, and enjoy a winter wander that feels like a treat rather than a task. Fresh air, good company, and a change of scenery: it’s hard to think of a better way to ease into the stretch between Christmas and the New Year.

Back Best food halls and street food spots in Greater Manchester By Visit Manchester on Jul. 01, 2022 10 min read Whether you’re searching for new flavours, are an indecisive eater or simply need a place with options to suit everyone’s tastebuds, Manchester’s Street food offering could be the answer. With a mix of cuisines and flavours all under one roof, what could be better? In the last few years, street food halls have become a firm favourite with Manchester’s residents and visitors alike, and it’s a good job we have plenty to choose from. With street food vendors ranging from the authentic to the quirky, street food halls offer a place for some of the most exciting up-and-coming chefs to make the food they love at a reasonable price, and we can all benefit. Some of Manchester’s previous street food offerings have now become some of our best-loved restaurants, with food halls giving talented chef’s a much-needed platform to show what they can do. Far from the days of street food meaning a single lonely burger van, Greater Manchester’s Street food scene has exploded in recent years with establishments popping up all over the city-region. Foodies love the fuss-free, casual nature of these places but also the chance to try something new without a hefty price tag. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a quick bite or to spend an afternoon with friends trying a mix of foods and drinks as you go, street food halls offer quality, delicious food and great places to chill. We’ve rounded up some of the best street food markets and food halls, so that next time you’re searching for a bite to eat, you know where to go. Mackie Mayor On the edge of Manchester’s beloved Northern Quarter, you’ll find a Grade II listed market building (the only remaining building from the Smithfield market) which is now home to some of Manchester’s favourite street food vendors. Mackie Mayor is a modern food hall which has precisely the urban, relaxed vibe you’d expect from its location. With great offerings for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner, you really could spend all day eating in here. There are currently nine independent kitchens and bars showcasing the best regional food and drink. The vendors include Honest Crust Pizza, Tender Cow, Baohouse, Fin Fish Bar and Reserve Wines. It doesn’t matter whether you’re looking for a coffee or something a little more exotic, there’s something for everyone. Plus, it’s dog-friendly, so furry friends can come along too! GRUB Just five minutes’ walk from Manchester Victoria station, just outside of the hustle and bustle of Manchester city centre, a converted textile warehouse hosts Manchester’s longest-running street food market. Describing itself as Manchester’s biggest and friendliest street food venue, GRUB is open Wednesday to Sunday at The Red Bank Project. It has a mix of indoor and outdoor spaces including Manchester’s best-kept secret beer garden. Street food is served week in, week out by Manchester’s best independent businesses. You'll find that Rudy’s Pizza and Hip Hop Chip Shop started here once upon a time. You’ll be spoilt for choice with a huge range of vendors covering a whole range of cuisines from Greek to Sri Lankan and absolutely everything in between. There are even vendors to satisfy your sweet tooth because your dessert stomach needs feeding too. Escape to Freight Island If you like your street food served with a side of entertainment, Escape to Freight Island could be for you. In the heart of the regeneration of Depot Mayfield, this market and festival space offers incredible food and drink alongside entertainment and events. It’s home to several different restaurants, food trucks and bars serving up everything from “the most popular burger in Manchester” to American pies. It’s safe to say you’ll be spoilt for choice. Escape to Freight Island also regularly team up with Manchester chefs and restaurants to create one-of-a-kind dishes for a limited time, which should be enough of a reason to draw you back in. Sit outside or inside and enjoy the eclectic mix of events, entertainment and flavours at the party animal of Manchester’s street food scene. Society MCR A hub of street food, craft beer and cocktails, Society is a recent addition to Manchester city centre’s street food scene, but it’s a great one.

Back Vintage Shops in Manchester City Centre By Visit Manchester on May 25, 2023 10 min read If there is one thing us Mancunian's are mad on - it's the way we style our selves. Just like the impact of our music, our fashion has also created waves in the fashion world and reflections of the Manchester style influence can be seen nationwide and WORLDwide. Manchester is renowned for it's vintage clothing style which is funny because we have lots of vintage and retro clothes shops. However, to answer '""What came first? The chicken or the egg?,' I am not sure whether it was the shops that came first or the style - lets just call it a mix of the two. Anyway, I'll leave that thought with you as well as this list of all the vintage and retro shops located in Manchester City Centre. Bare Necessities 39 Parker St, Manchester M1 4AJ Located on the forever growing Oxford Road corridor, Bare Necessities opened its shop in 2019 to offer an alternative solution in the fight against fast fashion. Bare Necessities mission is to source the highest quality of second-hand retro and vintage clothing at the lowest possible price for their customers. The store is ideally located close to the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University grounds. Customers can expect to find an abundance of clothing organised in a beautiful rainbow to make your shopping experience more enjoyable and less tedious sifting. Lots of jeans, sweatshirts, dresses, shirts all at amazingly affordable prices. Thrift Shop 39 Parker St, Manchester M1 4AJ In the prime of the city centre, you can hop off the bus and walk straight into Thrift Shop store. Thrift Shop is part of the We Are Cow family, so you are guaranteed to find some cool and trendy vintage bits and pieces. What sets this shop apart from the rest is their nifty pricing scheme – rails with hangers in certain colours are priced at a set price and a good price at that too! Which is perfect if you’re on a budget as you can shop in the suitable sections without any price jump scares. The rails are always full and vibrant, you may have to do some digging but the finds are so worth it! British Heart Foundation 51 Piccadilly, Manchester M1 2AP I know you have probably heard of The British Heart Foundation charity shop before, but what makes the one in Piccadilly Gardens extra special, is the fabulous vintage section located at the front of the shop. You can find some one-hit wonder items of clothing spanning back all the way from the 1940s. As always, the rest of the shop is filled with lots of other second-hand garments, as well as brand new with tags clothing from various brands such as Zara and Pretty Little Thing. I know, not exactly slow fashion but it’s still closing the gap in the circle, and I guess a guilt-free way of buying a fast-fashion garment. Empire Exchange 1 Newton St, Manchester M1 1HW To pre-warn this shop is rather whacky and should definitely be renamed to The Eccentric Empire Exchange Emporium . If you do not manage to hear the shop via the retro sound system blasting some classic vinyl records out of the front, then you can find the shop manually on Newton Street just off Piccadilly Gardens. This second-hand, collectables shop has been going strong for over 35 years and has been left in a time frozen bubble ever since, stepping down into this lair, if you dare, is like taking a trip down memory lane. A cave full of nostalgic treasures, from vinyl to CDs (CDS? What are they?), to trinkets, comics, and ginormous props from the BBC, as well as a naughty adult corner for some vintage X-rated content. The iconic Empire Exchange Emporium is a place that is so vintage you could go in and come out forgetting what year it is! We encourage everyone to visit this iconic shop, as we must protect it at all costs from the big corporate shops taking over! Blue Rinse 1 Newton St, Manchester M1 1HW Blue Rinse started off as an online vintage clothing company and now they have 2 physical stores with 1 choosing to open its doors here in Manchester! Don’t get me wrong, online shopping is very fun and convenient but to be able try before you buy, especially with vintage clothing it is quite the blessing. Alongside the regular stock of vintage clothing, Blue Rinse sell their very own range of reworked clothing. All of the items of clothing are one-off pieces – haute-couture if you will, handmade by the brilliant team at Blue Rinse . What I love most about this shop is the number of cool accessories, from funky earrings, to wavy sunglasses, tremendous ties, bags – they even sell braces for your trousers! Now that’s what I call true vintage. Pop Boutique 34 - 36 Oldham St, Manchester M1 1JN Pop Boutique was founded back in 1983 and its first permanent shop was opened inside our very own Affleck's Palace in 1985. Nowadays, you can still find this fragment of history and take yourself back to shopping like its 1985 in Affleck’s Palace, or you can visit their larger independent store, located opposite Afflecks on Oldham’s Street. Pop Boutique is still as much of a shrine to vintage shoppers as it was back in the 80s. You can guarantee all clothing is of a high-quality and you’re guaranteed to exit the shop with a real vintage treasure. The layout is impeccable with rails and rails and rails and rails, plus mannequins and yes, you guessed it, more rails. Included in these rails are vintage Levi’s jackets and jeans, as well as silk shirts, retro sweaters and all the bits in between…You can also find completely one-off pieces by shopping through their rePop range of recycled materials turned into new garments, which compete with the current trending silhouettes without the fast-fashion guilt. Afflecks 52 Church St, Manchester M4 1PW Warning, you might get lost in the iconic Afflecks but it’s so worth it because when you eventually make your way out, you’ll be leaving with a whole new and extremely trendy wardrobe. There are multiple shops full of trinkets, retro gadgets, copious badges, plants, incense sticks in every flavour, tattoo parlours, piercing shops, vinyl and tapes and of course, lots of pre-loved vintage clobber! Beg, Steal, Borrow Second floor A personal favourite, (if that is allowed) would be Beg, Steal, Borrow , located on the second floor of Afflecks. The shop is like taking a step into a 2000s groovy chick’s dream bedroom! The pink painted walls are decorated with iconic 2000s memorabilia including fluffy telephones and funky framed mirrors. Clothing wise, there are lots to choose from, clothing is carefully sorted into separate rails for dresses, skirts, jackets, trousers and clearly labelled in sizes. There are also an abundance of bags and shoes, which for a vintage shop there aren’t many genuine vintage shoes. The clothing is reasonably priced and there are also boxes where you can dig and find some real bargains! The staff are also as equally friendly to the level of trendy they are. A particular service that Beg, Steal, Borrow offer is a trade in. Customers can bring their unwanted clothing and staff will choose items and in return you can get a voucher of equal worth to spend in the store! Milner and Son's First floor If it’s a nice vintage jacket you’re after or some deadstock Docs, then Milner and Son ’s shop is the place to go. Located amid the midst of it all on the second floor, Milner and Son have a variety of vintage garments and gadgets from a wide scope of different time periods. Stocking classic vintage pieces and brand names. These brands include Carhartt, Barbour, Harley Davidson, Dickies & many more. They also do their bit to fight against fast fashion trends by saving unwanted clothes from ending up in landfill. Vintage Wardrobe First floor On the second floor there is also ‘ Vintage Wardrobe ’ who pride themselves on being allies with the LGBTQIA+ community, their products are non-gendered, and they promote fundraising and events. In the vintage wardrobe you can find all sorts of archived pieces, from glittery tops, crochet shawls, checked shirts, fur coats, patchworked dresses and lots more! Pop Boutique Ground floor As well as the store on Oldham Street, Pop Boutique also has a little space packed with their vintage and recycled pieces in Afflecks. ZEFFA First floor ZEFFA is the longest standing, OG shop if you like, of Afflecks and has a reputation for selling alternative vintage clothing. A vast selection of Levi’s, competitively priced vintage leather jackets and trousers. There is also a diverse range of accessories for both men and women. GRIN First floor If you don’t fancy going all the way into Afflecks and need a quick vintage fix, GRIN who are located on the ground floor, a small collection of vintage clothing and sunglasses but they do also stock a range of hair dyes if you want to completely revamp your style and complete your look. Oxfam Originals Unit 8, Smithfield Buildings, 51, Oldham St, Manchester M1 1JR What sets Oxfam Originals apart from the average Oxfam charity shop is that the clothing and accessories are strictly vintage and designer pieces. All items have been hand-picked specifically for the stores, so that customers can be ‘Original’ when shopping. The shop has clothing from all areas, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s! From eccentric ties to vintage skirt suits, shirts in all colours and patterns, to dresses for every occasion – including your own wedding! And of course, Oxfam welcomes you to donate any of your own unwanted clothes and accessories. Cow Vintage – We Are Cow 61 Church St, Manchester M4 1PD Cow Vintage have several stores across the UK. Everything in the store is ethically sourced, even the furnishings are made from 90% of recycled materials! We Are Cow handpick their items from various hubs around the world and sell them for affordable prices. You can find pieces that have already stood the test of time from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s and the not-so-distant 00s. We Are Cow , also sell a wide variety of iconic archived brands alongside their own rework range so, you are bound to find something unique! Bags of Flavour 33 Tib St, Manchester M4 1LX Another Manchester ye olde favourite vintage shop would of course be, Bags of Flavour . You know like how even in a 30g of Walker’s Cheese Onion Crisps the flavour is still strong? That is exactly this shop…even though Bags of Flavour is small regarding space, it’s well stocked! This is a perfect shop for those when the idea of trawling through endless mish mashed rails of clothes is all too daunting. In the well-organised Bags of Flavour shop, you can find all the classic vintage brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Fred Perry, Nike etc. for a decent price. The shop owner who runs the place is also incredibly friendly and knowledgeable in the fashion field. Suzy Loves Milo, Hatch + Concept NQ 40 Spear St, Manchester M1 1AS 103 Oxford Rd, Manchester M1 7ED You can find Suzy Loves Milo in two places in the city centre. One of the locations is inside HATCH off The Oxford Road Corridor. The second, just off of Stevenson Square on Spear Street, under the name of Concept NQ. What sets the shops apart from the average vintage shop is that the owners Bob and THE Suzy, have personally handpicked all of the items and not bulk bought from wholesalers. Bob and Suzy take fashion influence from all corners of the world, particularly taking inspiration from Korea and Japan hence you’ll see a lot of Evisu. Slightly on the more expensive side of the second-hand spectrum but it’s very worth it!

These numbers are free to call and should only be used in a true emergency – when an immediate response is required, and someone is in immediate danger. To report a non-urgent crime to the police, call 101, and to get advice from the NHS on a non-emergency medical situation call 111.

For information on what to do during a major incident, Greater Manchester Prepared has all the resources you need. For all the latest transport information, go to Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). Out and about at night Always keep your belongings with you and in sight when in bars and restaurants – many venues have dedicated bag and coat rooms, and some have clips under tables to secure bags. Keep your drink with you at all times, and don’t accept drinks from strangers. If you feel unsafe in a venue for any reason, go to a member of staff and ask for ‘Angela’, and someone will assist you. More information on the ‘Ask for Angela’ scheme can be found here . Travel Plan your route before you leave – use the journey planner at the TfGM website. Only use taxis or licenced mini-cabs . Don’t walk alone at night, and stick to well-lit main streets and roads. Always keep your belongings with you and in sight when using public transport. Take notice of your surroundings and be aware when wearing headphones. In the UK, cars drive on the left. To cross roads safely, use designated crossings, cross when the green man is showing and take note of the signs indicating ‘look right’ or ‘look left’ to spot oncoming traffic. For more safe travel tips, visit the TfGM website . General tips Don’t leave your bags or belongings unattended anywhere in Manchester, as this can cause a security alert. Report unattended bags or belongings in public spaces to the police. When using an ATM, check that no one is looking over your shoulder and shield your pin when typing it in. Don’t carry too much cash, and use a money belt to keep cash and other documents safe when out and about. Be aware of your surroundings when using your mobile phone in public places. Download the free citizenAID app on Android or Apple which gives advice on actions to take in case of an incident. Report any hate crime to the GM Police . Ratings Powered by",605

Bridgewater Canal in Sale Explore Trafford The home of Manchester United Football Club and Emirates Old Trafford , Trafford is widely held as an international sporting destination, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. For adrenaline junkies Chill Factore is the ideal tourist destination, the UK’s longest and widest real snow indoor slope, at 100 metres wide and 180 metres long. If history is what you're looking for, head to the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Imperial War Museum North , an extraordinary exhibition space that delivers an immersive experience documenting the voices of ordinary people of over a century of war, plus, while you're there, you can make your way over to the cobbles for a tour of the world's longest running soap, Coronation Street . Trafford boasts history and heritage with over 200 listed buildings, including the beautiful 18th-century Dunham Massey , and is home to a plethora of outstanding nature reserves. Highlighting the natural beauty and countryside in Trafford, Sale Water Park includes an incredible 52-acre lake which is also the site of the Broad Ees Dole wildlife refuge, a local nature reserve which provides a home for migratory birds. When it comes to entertainment, and shopping, The Trafford Centre has it all under one roof. With hundreds of stores, including the first Selfridges outside of London, a 20-screen Odeon multiplex cinema, a Laser Quest arena, Paradise Island miniature golf and a Namco Funscape arcade and bowling alley and Europe’s largest food court, it really does cater for all tastes. Plus, Trafford comprises the towns of Sale, Stretford, Altrincham, and Urmston, meaning there’s even more to explore. Discover Trafford: Manchester’s metropolitan borough This in-depth guide to Trafford covers the very best things to do locally – from browsing an artisan market in Urmston to ice skating in Altrincham. Situated to the south west of Manchester city centre, the borough of Trafford spans historic sporting grounds, over 200 listed buildings and beautiful green spaces. The home of Manchester United Football Club and Lancashire County Cricket Club, this is also the area to visit if you fancy a spot of indoor skiing or exploring an inflatable theme park. From the staggering exhibitions at IWM North through to gigs at Victoria Warehouse and films at the plush Everyman Altrincham, Trafford has no shortage of cultural things to do. Head to the independent restaurants and bars in Urmston or Stretford Food Hall for refreshments, to Dunham Massey or Walkden Gardens for an escape into nature. Trafford has it all. It’s also an area that’s easy to navigate. The borough is bordered by the Manchester Ship Canal on one side, with the Bridgewater Way providing a walking and cycling link from the city centre through to the towns of Old Trafford, Stretford, Sale and Altrincham. Old Trafford and Trafford Park occupy the northernmost part of the borough, closest to Manchester city centre, with Urmston to the south east, Stretford to the south west, Sale below this and Altrincham towards the southern edge of the district. With train, tram and bus routes connecting the best things to see and do locally, you can cover a lot of ground in a day. Old Trafford and Trafford Park are the borough’s sporting strongholds. Close to the Old Trafford tram stop is the world-famous home of Manchester United Football Club, Old Trafford Stadium . Matches here are always electric, and you can visit on non-match days for a museum and stadium tour. See the players’ tunnel, walk next to the iconic pitch and drop into the dugouts. Hotel Football, with its rooms, restaurant and matchday hospitality, is nearby, while the similarly historic Emirates Old Trafford cricket ground is just a 15 minute walk away. If you fancy dabbling in a spot of exercise yourself, head to the inflatable arena at Inflata Nation , or for the frozen slopes at Chill Factore, Manchester’s £31m real snow centre. The closest tram stop to Inflata Nation is Parkway, while Chill Factore is only a 15 minute walk from the new Trafford Centre Metrolink. There’s more to this area than sport, however. The OT Art Trail , funded by Arts Council England, has seen the walls in a triangle of streets east of the cricket ground decorated with murals. Trafford Ecology Park is a beautiful green oasis close to the ship canal, open to the public most weekdays and available to book for corporate volunteering, environmental training and outdoor learning activities. Easily reachable from both the Old Trafford and Pomona tram stops, Victoria Warehouse is an events venue and hotel all under one roof, host to gigs, exhibitions and sporting fixtures, while Sea Life Manchester transports its visitors into an incredible underwater world. The aquarium is based at the Trafford Centre, a one-stop shopping and leisure destination, and now on the new Metrolink tram line that leads back into the city centre. Also with its own Metrolink stop is IWM North, a national museum reflecting on conflict and its impact. Winner of multiple awards and home to J.R.R. Tolkien’s revolver from the Battle of the Somme, IWM North is recognised as one of the top four Large Visitor attractions in the country. Urmston Urmston is to the south of the Trafford Centre, and has been undergoing a bit of a revamp in recent years. In the town centre, there’s a highly rated pub and beer shop Prairie Schooner Taphouse , as well as wine bar and shop Kelder Wines and The Steamhouse, a pub in a refurbished station building. Urmston’s Eden Square shopping complex is a hub of high street stores, while the monthly Urmston Artisan Market brings street food, vintage and crafts to the Golden Hill car park, just six minutes’ walk from the town’s train station. For a slice of green space with a miniature railway, Abbotsfield Park isn’t far – alternatively, head to either Davyhulme Park Golf Club or Flixton Golf Club to spend a pleasant few hours navigating the green. Stretford Best reached on the tram from the city centre, or by following the Bridgewater Canal on foot or by bike, Stretford is to the east of Urmston. The town centre is at the crossroads of a major junction, with Stretford Mall on one side and Stretford Public Hall on the other. Stretford Mall is home to a Food Hall, complete with street food stalls, a craft beer bar and coffee counter, as well as The Longford Tap , a popular bar in Stretford selling craft beers, cask ales, wine and spirits. The monthly Stretford Precinct Market also takes place here on the last Saturday of the month, bringing fresh produce, crafts, gifts, food and more to the town centre. Stretford Public Hall , meanwhile, hosts classes, activities and events in a community-owned, multi-purpose building. Sale Sale is south of Stretford, the next stop on the Metrolink and only an 11 minute cycle via the Bridgewater Canal. The Square shopping centre in this already popular town is about to undergo a £70m transformation – but for now there’s still plenty to make a visit worthwhile. The Waterside arts centre has long been host to fascinating exhibitions, events and theatre, and is classed as an important regional hub for both performance and visual art. Look out for the monthly Makers Market in Stanley Square, or you might want to pair a circular walk to Sale Water Park, where there’s a lake, woodland, meadows, eateries and the Trafford Water Sports Centre, with a meal at The Bridge Pub and Dining . Walkden Gardens, in the opposite direction, would work equally well for a stroll: this small but beautiful series of gardens is occasionally host to performances and special events. Altrincham Another four stops on the tram is Altrincham : here, shops, restaurants and bars radiate out towards Altrincham Market, occupying a mixture of buildings both modern and historic. Opened in 2014, the market itself helped to drive the transformation of the town centre. With incredible food traders occupying a beautiful market building and outdoor stalls to one side, Altrincham Market gets very busy, but is always worth the wait. One street away is the Everyman Altrincham cinema, where there’s plush armchair seating and waiter service during the screenings, or a short walk away is the Planet Ice skating rink. Explore the town’s bustling Stamford Quarter, and stop by Gran T’s Coffee House for sandwiches and freshly-baked pastries. The town’s two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and Altrincham Little Theatre , both a little way out of the centre, are also well worth a visit. Finally, no guide to Trafford would be complete without mentioning Dunham Massey, a beautiful garden and treasure-filled house situated within an ancient deer park. This National Trust property is a joy to explore: around an hour’s walk south from Altrincham, the estate is a short diversion from the Bridgewater Way by bike. This handy map outlines the walking route and bus stops nearby.

The Lowry Theatre Read More Art and culture in Manchester Spend a day in Manchester and it rapidly becomes apparent just how much the city has reinvented its industrial past into a new, trendsetting present - and an ambitious future. Today, the listed buildings of the world’s first inter-city passenger railway house the Science & Industry Museum , a globally important heritage site, while the monumental columns of a former trading hall - once an international cotton exchange - hold up the UK’s biggest theatre in the round at the Royal Exchange . Manchester’s world-class art and textiles collections, held by Manchester Art Gallery and the redeveloped Whitworth , were amassed as a result of the city’s great post-industrial wealth and world standing - without which, exceptional buildings such as the Grade I listed John Rylands Library would not have been possible. The Quays - now home to MediaCityUK, the largest media hub in Europe, national museum IWM North and Manchester’s most visited cultural attraction The Lowry - is an area that has been transformed from the busiest industrial dock in the UK, to a 21st century cultural centre in just over 100 years.

Back Manchester's Hidden Gems: A Local Guide for Winter By Visit Manchester on Dec. 19, 2025 18 min read Discover Manchester’s hidden gems, from historic libraries and secret bars to an elevated walkway in the heart of the city. Explore the Northern Quarter’s independent scene, uncover hidden food and drink spots, dive into Manchester's late-night culture scene or venture beyond the city centre to discover more across Greater Manchester. Here's A Local Guide to Hidden Gems in Manchester this Winter: Cultural Gems in Manchester Spots in Manchester that feel like Hogwarts Discover Manchester's Independent Scene Hidden Bars and Restaurants in Manchester Late Night Spots Explore Greater Manchester Cultural Gems in Manchester Back to Top of List Manchester is packed with cultural gems, many of them hidden in plain sight in the city centre. Historic spaces like Chetham’s Library and The John Rylands Research Institute and Library sit seamlessly alongside modern architecture, while the Abraham Lincoln Statue and The Golden Ball at Manchester Town Hall, often overlooked, reflect a city rich in history and heritage. The Abraham Lincoln Statue Location: Lincoln Square Manchester’s Abraham Lincoln statue is an easy-to-miss landmark with a big story. The statue serves as a poignant reminder of the role that Victorian Manchester played in the US Civil War and the eventual abolishment of slavery. It was gifted to the city in 1919 and honours the local workers who supported the end of slavery during the American Civil War. It stands as a simple reminder of the city’s strong values and sense of justice. The Golden Ball (The Sun Always Shines) Location: Manchester Town Hall On top of the spire of the Manchester Town Hall Clock is a golden ball with spikes. Roughly the height of a person, it was designed to represent a cotton bud about to burst - a reference to the industry that played a major role in Manchester’s growth. The cotton motif appears throughout the city, and the sculpture is also often linked to the sun, reflecting Manchester’s global connections and influence. Manchester Art Gallery Location: Mosley Street Manchester Art Gallery is home to classic and contemporary art, including an excellent Pre-Raphaelite collection. Chinatown Location: Chinatown And don’t miss the colourful sights of nearby Chinatown , just a few minutes away, with colourful shopfronts, restaurants, and the distinctive red archway that marks its entrance. Gay Village – Canal Street Location: Gay Village, Canal Street Manchester’s Gay Village (Canal Street) is famous for its lively atmosphere and colourful drag queen murals. With its rainbow flags, neon lights, and reflections along the canal, it perfectly captures the city’s energy and personality. Science and Industry Museum Location: Liverpool Road, Castlefield The Science and Industry Museum is one of Manchester’s standout cultural gems, offering a glimpse into the city’s industrial past and technological achievements.

Spots in Manchester that feel like Hogwarts Back to Top of List 1. The John Rylands Library The John Rylands Library is one of Manchester’s true hidden gems – and a must-visit for any Harry Potter fan.

Back Manchester to Oldham: A Simple Day-Trip Itinerary By Visit Manchester on Dec. 24, 2025 4 min read Oldham is often overlooked, but it makes a great day out from Manchester. Sitting right on the edge of the Pennines, it’s ideal if you want fresh air, local history and good places to eat without travelling far. This one-day itinerary keeps things simple: start outdoors, take in the canals, parks and reservoirs around the town, explore a bit of Oldham’s history along the way, and finish the day in the centre, where its food and drink scene is quietly growing. Here's Visit Manchester's One-Day Itinerary to Oldham: Morning: Explore Oldham's Countryside Afternoon: Explore Oldham's Food and Drink Scene Travel Information Morning: Explore Oldham's Countryside Back to Top of List Oldham sits right on the edge of the Pennines, which means it's surrounded by beautiful countryside. Here's a series of easy, flat walks to enjoy across the borough: Dovestone Reservoir Dovestone Reservoir is a good place to start your day. It's open, quiet and easy to walk around. The main path is flat, so you can take your time and enjoy the fresh air. Tandle Hill Country Park Tandle Hill Country Park is a local favourite. Enjoy woodland paths, grassy areas and a few gentle climbs that lead to wide views over Greater Manchester (and a great photo opportunity!). It's a lovely spot if you're looking to get outside for a bit. Uppermill and Diggle via Huddersfield Narrow Canal (5-mile Circular Route through Saddleworth) Starting in Uppermill, follow the Huddersfield Narrow Canal , pass by old stone cottages, and discover sights of the area’s industrial past. As you wander towards Diggle, you’ll pass Standedge Tunnel, the longest canal tunnel in the UK. From Diggle, the route transcends into open countryside offering stunning views over the Pennines. It’s the perfect spot to soak in the scenery before heading back into Uppermill. Alexandra Park Alexandra Park is a Victorian public park in Oldham, opened in 1865 during the town’s industrial period. It includes walking paths, a boating lake and open green space, and is still widely used by local residents. Northern Roots Northern Roots is a large green space on the edge of Oldham that's being developed into an urban farm and community area. It's a working space rather than a finished park, with walking paths, growing areas and plans shaped by local people. It's a good place to slow down and see how the town is investing in green space and food growing. Afternoon: Explore Oldham's Food and Drink Scene Back to Top of List After spending the morning exploring Oldham’s countryside, head into the town centre.

Back Celebrating Manchester’s Music Scene During the BRITs and MOBOs — Ticket or No Ticket By Visit Manchester on Dec. 05, 2025 8 min read Manchester’s about to take centre stage. With the BRIT Awards and the MOBOs both heading north, the city is gearing up for a year that will shine a fresh spotlight on its musical identity. The BRITs will break tradition by leaving London for the first time, taking over Co-op Live , and a few weeks later the MOBO Awards will arrive to celebrate three decades of championing Black music and culture. Tickets, unsurprisingly, will be snapped up fast. But whether you’ve managed to bag a seat inside the arena or not, Manchester is one of the UK’s true music capitals. The streets, neighbourhoods and venues tell a story all of their own, and there’s no shortage of ways to soak in the atmosphere. Legendary clubs, influential record labels, iconic murals and historic gig spots are scattered across the city, offering countless opportunities to dive into its musical past and present. This guide brings together some of the best ways to explore Manchester’s musical heritage while the BRITs and MOBOs are in town – no ticket necessary. Manchester's BRIT Trophy The trophy, designed by Manchester-born designer Matthew Williamson , was unveiled at a special event celebrating the city’s creative heritage and the University of Manchester’s role in arts, design, music, and performance. The John Rylands Research Institute and Library , home to the British Pop Archive – the UK’s first large-scale collection of popular and youth culture – highlighted the significance of the occasion. Williamson’s design reflects Manchester’s identity. Made from amber-toned resin, evoking the golden honey of the worker bee, the city’s symbol of resilience, the trophy sits atop a globe representing the global reach of British music. Williamson joins a distinguished list of artists who have shaped the BRITs trophy, including Vivienne Westwood, Zaha Hadid, Tracey Emin, and Yinka Ilori. A City Soundtrack: Manchester’s Popular Music History Manchester’s music story isn’t tucked away behind glass or hidden in museum cabinets. It’s written into the fabric of the streets – in old mills turned venues, blue plaques marking revolutionary gigs and murals honouring the artists who shaped entire genres. The decision to host both major awards here in 2026 makes sense. Few cities have contributed as much to British music. Below are some of the key chapters in Manchester’s popular musical journey. Pop & Early Rock While Liverpool often takes the spotlight for the 1960s, Manchester played a pivotal part in shaping the nation’s pop and rock identity. The Bee Gees spent their early years in Chorlton before achieving global fame with their unmistakable harmonies, while The Hollies, formed in the city in 1962, became one of Britain’s most successful bands of the era. Alongside this, all-night Caribbean clubs and Moss Side shebeens helped shape the city’s cultural identity. They provided a familiar space for the West Indian community while introducing wider audiences to Black music - influences that would feed into the city’s musical evolution for decades. Northern Soul Few movements capture Northern passion quite like Northern soul. Emerging in the early 1970s, it championed rare American soul records and created a dance culture unlike anything else. Manchester’s Twisted Wheel became the heartbeat of the scene, attracting fans from across the country to its talc-dusted floors and all-night sessions. Its legacy still lives on, with Northern soul nights continuing throughout the city, including sets from the much-loved Deptford Northern Soul Club . Free Trade Hall The Free Trade Hall is a pillar of Manchester’s musical heritage. Built in 1855, it hosted everything from classical recitals to genre-defining gigs. The most famous? The Sex Pistols’ 1976 performance – a night often credited with sparking Manchester’s punk and post-punk scenes. In that audience were future members of Joy Division and The Smiths, key figures behind Factory Records, and journalists who would go on to shape the narrative of British music. What happened in that room would change the city’s musical direction forever. Factory Records At the heart of Manchester’s post-punk and early ‘Madchester’ movement was Factory Records. Co-founded by Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus, the label launched the careers of Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays, The Durutti Column and more. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Haçienda You can’t talk about Manchester without mentioning the Haçienda. More than a nightclub, it was the epicentre of the city’s rave culture and electronic explosion. Run by Factory Records and immortalised by its legendary DJs – including DJ Paulette, Graeme Park and Mike Pickering – it fuelled the rise of the ‘Madchester’ movement. The building may now be flats and apartments, but its impact reverberates far beyond Whitworth Street. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Smiths The Smiths helped define 1980s indie, pairing Johnny Marr’s shimmering guitar work with Morrissey’s lyrical bite. Their influence is global, and Manchester landmarks linked to them, such as Salford Lads’ Club , have become essential stops for fans. You’ll find murals dedicated to band members dotted around the city too, celebrating their legacy. Britpop & Oasis The 1990s brought a new wave exploded. Britpop, with Manchester once again at the forefront. While bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays laid much of the groundwork, Oasis became the era’s defining act. Raised in Burnage, the Gallagher brothers turned small venues such as the Boardwalk into musical folklore. Even shops like Sifters Records became part of the story, immortalised in lyrics and loved by fans. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Indie Wave of the 2000s The story didn’t stop in the 1990s. Bands including The Courteeners, Blossoms and The 1975 kept Manchester on the indie map, honing their craft in grassroots venues across the city. By 2018, Manchester had been named the UK’s rock and indie capital – a testament to its gig culture and thriving small venues such as the Manchester Academy complex. Rap & Grime Manchester’s contribution to rap and grime is just as significant. The Ruthless Rap Assassins, formed in Hume, helped lay early foundations, blending punk and hip-hop influences. Kermit, one of the group’s members, later joined Shaun Ryder in Black Grape, adding another chapter to Manchester’s hybrid musical story. The city’s modern wave, including Bugzy Malone and Aitch, has taken Manchester’s voice nationwide. Their rise from local stages to festival headliners reflects a city that continually reinvents itself musically. Catch a Live Gig While You’re Here Catching a live gig is a must. From the huge arenas – Co-op Live and AO Arena – to intimate pubs and independent venues, the city pulses with live music every night.

Starting with football, Manchester is home to two world-famous and iconic football teams; Manchester City and Manchester United. Though a local rivalry exists, the two teams have propelled Manchester onto the global stage in world football. Manchester United are at home in Old Trafford, the largest club football stadium in the UK, whilst Manchester City occupy the recently expanded Etihad Stadium, which was originally built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. With both clubs offering stadium and club tours, as well as unique match day experiences, a visit is a must for any sports fan visiting Manchester.

Swimming and cycling world-champion Paralympian Dame Sarah Storey, Taekwondo stars Jade Jones and Lutalo Muhammed, cyling gold medallists Jason Kenny and Laura Trott, relay medallist Kelly Massey, and 2016 gold-medallist hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh MBE all either live or train in Manchester. Manchester is also the home to many other well-known sports teams. The Manchester Giants Basketball team reformed in 2011, and have reclaimed their place in the professional British Basketball League.

Dovestone Reservoir Explore Manchester's countryside North of the city - around the towns of Bury, Bolton, Wigan, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford and Tameside - you'll find more than 500 square miles of inspiring countryside, crisscrossed by historical waterways and dotted with picturesque towns and fascinating attractions that make for great days out of the city. For pure peaceful escape from the hurly burly of the city, dip into the region's country parks. In the heart of Wigan, Haigh Hall and Country Park offers 40 miles of secluded woodland trails and canal towpaths running through 250 acres of park and woodland. A walk round beautiful Dovestone Reservoir takes about an hour, and the picturesque Pennine village of Saddleworth is another highlight. The exhilarating South and West Pennine Moors run through the region too, offering miles of cycleways and bridleways for walkers and riders to recharge and unwind in the great outdoors. Look out for, Hollingworth Lake in Rochdale, once a traditional destination for local mill workers, it sits in a popular country park and is an ideal gateway to the South Pennines. North Manchester is crisscrossed by canals, a lasting reminder of Manchester's industrial heritage. Today they provide tranquil, traffic-free cycling routes, places of historical significance, havens for wildlife, heritage trails and peaceful picnic sites. The Rochdale Canal is the broad waterway that opened up the route through the valleys to the magnificent Pennine moors. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal , which flows through the villages of Oldham, has the unusual bonus of a canal-side sculpture trail for you to take in too. North Manchester has many historic towns and villages that are well worth a visit. The picturesque Saddleworth villages of Diggle, Dobcross and Uppermill are surrounded by dramatic Pennine moorland. Over in Bolton there's also lovely Smithills Hall , a restored fourteenth-century Lancashire manor house with formal gardens, and Hall I'th' Wood, a part-timbered Tudor merchant's house where Samuel Crompton invented the revolutionary ""spinning mule"" in 1779.

Back Manchester named as one of the best places to visit in 2024 by The New York Times By Visit Manchester on Jan. 10, 2024 2 min read Manchester has been selected by The New York Times to feature in its annual ‘52 Places to Go’ list for 2024 . The US publication’s annual list of where to travel features Manchester as a ‘music-mad city’, selecting it at number 12 in the global destinations it recommends visiting in the year ahead . Major musical milestones for the city are cited, including the opening of Co-Op Live, which will be the UK’s biggest music venue when it opens in April with a 23,500-capacity venue, and the Worldwide Music Expo (WOMEX), which will bring over 2,600 music professionals to the city in October. The article also mentions the reopening of Band on the Wall, Manchester’s oldest music venue, and New Century, one of the latest new venues to open, as reasons for the city’s inclusion in the prestigious list. The listing opens by stating: “Music has long been at the core of Manchester’s gritty soul, from Joy Division and the Stone Roses to Oasis and, now, Harry Styles, who is backing Britain’s largest new music arena, Co-op Live, set to open in April.” Recent cultural investments in the city are mentioned, including Aviva Studios, which opened as the home of Factory International in October 2023, and large-scale events including Beyond The Music, which brings a four-day music festival and conference to the city’s venues from 11-14 October 2024. Whilst already well-known for its rich music history and heritage, in recent years Greater Manchester has carved out a solid reputation as a place to enjoy live music. In addition to year-round gigs and performances at venues of all shape and size, Manchester’s spring and summer months are packed with outdoor concert series and festivals held at the city’s sporting stadiums, Castlefield Bowl, and Heaton and Wythenshawe Parks, then the city becomes a clubbing mecca throughout autumn and winter months at venues like Warehouse Project. The city’s reputation for a wider genre of music has also strengthened in recent years – the beloved Hallé Orchestra will this year welcome a new Principal Conductor and Artistic Director, Kahchun Wong, taking over from Sir Mark Elder who has led the orchestra for 24 years. In March, Manchester will host the Royal Philharmonic Society Awards – ‘the biggest night in UK classical music’ – for the first time outside of London. And it was announced in late 2023 that the English National Opera will relocate its main base from London to Manchester by 2029. Manchester’s inclusion in the global list places it alongside destinations including Singapore, Paris, Brisbane, and Vienna, and is the only destination in England to be included in the list of 52 locations .

When do New Year’s Eve events start in Manchester? Most parties and celebrations across Manchester kick off in the early evening, around 7 or 8 pm, and continue well past midnight. Family-friendly events in Greater Manchester, like fireworks displays, community gatherings, and special shows, often start earlier, giving little ones a chance to join in on the New Year’s fun without staying up too late. Are New Year’s Eve fireworks in Manchester free? It varies by event. Many of Manchester’s well-known New Year’s Eve firework displays are free for the public, particularly the larger ones in the city centre. It’s best to check your local council’s website to confirm whether any events are taking place in your area. Others, such as private parties, rooftop shows, or ticketed experiences in Greater Manchester, require advance booking. If you want the best vantage points, it’s worth planning ahead. Do I need to book tickets in advance for New Year’s celebrations? Yes - Manchester is one of the UK’s top destinations for New Year’s Eve, and tickets for popular clubs, bars, restaurants, and shows often sell out weeks in advance. If you’re planning a night out, a festive dinner, or a family-friendly experience, booking early is the safest way to guarantee a spot. How easy is it to get around Manchester on New Year’s Eve? Getting around Greater Manchester on New Year’s Eve can be tricky if you haven’t planned ahead. Public transport, including trains, trams, and buses, often run on a modified schedule, and taxis or ride-shares can be in high demand. If you’re staying locally, walking between restaurants, bars, or event venues can be the easiest option. Otherwise, consider pre-booking taxis or checking transport timetables in advance to avoid any last-minute stress.

Jewelry by Women Artists ""*, the Museum of Applied Arts Cologne (MAKK) brings the fascinating world of women artists' jewelry to life for the first time. A novelty in Germany in this thematic depth, the exhibition shows around 90 pieces of jewelry by 45 pioneering female artists of the 20th and 21st centuries - including iconic positions such as Niki de Saint Phalle, Meret Oppenheim and Yoko Ono, but also surprising discoveries from contemporary art such as Alicja Kwade. Each work is more than just jewelry - it is a vision turned miniature. Whether minimalist forms, a strong sculptural presence or a playful sense of humor: the objects condense artistic trends of the time and transform them into wearable statements. As a tribute to female creativity, the exhibition deliberately breaks with conventions and opens up a new perspective on this field, which is often dominated by male perspectives. The field of tension oscillates between art, individuality and social attribution - from surrealist dreams to contemporary concepts. With this exhibition, the MAKK is building on the presentation ""Fascination Jewelry. 7000 Years of Jewelry Art at the MAKK"" and invites visitors to rediscover the museum as a place for innovative art education. The accompanying publication, published by the renowned arnoldsche Art Publishers, brings the exhibition to life far beyond Cologne - a collector's item.

Cologne,https://www.cologne-tourism.com/delight-diversity/gastronomy/breweries,1,"Brewery culture in Cologne: Kölsch, Köbes & Food | Cologne Tourism To content Search What are you looking for? Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking Brewery restaurants Drinking Kölsch , experiencing Cologne’s conviviality “Ich bin ein Kölsch,” said Bill Clinton after downing a glass of Mühlen Kölsch beer and eating a dish of Rhineland-style Sauerbraten with dumplings and applesauce in 1999. That may be why the Rhineland-style Sauerbraten is still the front-runner here in Cologne’s second-oldest brewery restaurant, the Brauerei zur Malzmühle. But there are many, many other options if you’re looking for an extensive tour of brewery restaurants — with or without Sauerbraten and hearty traditional dishes such as “Himmel un Äd” (Heaven and Earth), pork knuckle, and bratwurst. After all, Cologne is the only city that is permitted to brew its famous Kölsch beer. Top brewery restaurants Essentials of the brewery restaurant tour: the Köbes and the beer-coaster language There are so many brewery restaurants between the Cathedral, the Rathaus (Town Hall) and the Rhine Promenade that you’ll surely be putting your beer coaster on top of your Kölsch glass before you’ve gotten to know them all. With this gesture you’ll be showing the Köbes that enough is enough. It’s time to go home. What awaits you before you make this decision? Cologne’s most down-to-earth restaurants, full of lively cheer and unique rustic charm. There’s probably no other place where you can experience Cologne’s typical hearty yet gruff hospitality as vividly as in its brewery restaurants, whether they’re in the city centre or Cologne’s traditional Altstadt (Old Town). Cologne & Kölsch : all about the only language you can drink You might be wondering how it feels to be amidst the brewery restaurant atmosphere. Here conversation flows easily, differences disappear and people simply have a good time and drink together, in line with the well-known local song “Drink doch ene mit” (lift a glass with us). You can choose between approximately 25 brands of Kölsch brewed in Cologne. Apropos Kölsch: Thanks to the special way it’s brewed, this top-fermented beer makes better use of the sugar and malt than other types of beer, making it especially light and digestible. Kölsch is traditionally served by a waiter called a Köbes in the traditional gruff Köbes style — in a typical cylindrical Kölsch glass that holds 0.2 l. Because the glass is small, the Köbes rushes around with his round tray of glasses full of Kölsch, setting them down on customers’ tables. The beer is drawn from a 10 L barrel, and it’s always cool and fresh. So stop talking — and drink up! All about Kölsch and Köbes Speaking of the Köbes: in other places you might consider his behaviour rude, but here in Cologne’s brewery restaurants it’s part of the city’s unique culture. You could call the Köbes an outlier in the polite art of serving that is normally practised in Germany. His traditional brewery worker’s outfit consists of a blue knitted jacket with a high collar and a double row of black buttons, black trousers, a blue apron, and a leather pouch for money that is worn over his stomach. And his manner is part of the traditional brewery restaurant experience — it might be cheeky and rude, dry and deadpan, or then again hearty and cheerful. His changing moods might leave you either baffled or amused — it all depends on you. But there’s one thing that never changes: in a brewery restaurant, the Kölsch tradition is king. Brewery restaurants in Cologne: unchanged for centuries Cologne’s brewery restaurants can look back on a history that goes back for 500 years. In the year 1412, a decree of the magistrate of the city of Cologne established 21 breweries operated by professional guilds within the city walls. Cologne’s oldest breweries include the Brauhaus Sion on Unter Taschenmacher, which first opened its doors in 1511, as well as the Cölner Hofbräu P. Josef Früh am Dom near the Cathedral and the Brauerei Päffgen on the Friesenstraße, both of which are more than 100 years old. Visitors who enjoy exploring historical cultures of food and drink will be interested in joining one of Cologne’s guided brewery tours. The food critic Jürgen Dollase writes that the Päffgen brewery restaurant, which offers “clearly formulated prototypical Rhineland cuisine”, brews its brand of Cologne’s favourite beverage in its own cellar on the Friesenstraße — and brings it directly to your table. The hearty fare that goes with it includes curly kale with smoked sausage, beer-marinaded pork knuckle, schnitzel, bratwurst and half a roast chicken with chips. And of course the brewery restaurants also serve Kölsch specialities such as Halver Hahn (a rye bread roll with aged Gouda cheese and mustard), Rhineland-style Sauerbraten and fried black pudding or liver sausage. Enjoy your meal! Breweries & modernism in Cologne: a footnote Today even the brewery-restaurant culture has a modern variant. For example, you can also find brewery restaurants without a Köbes or serving international or seasonal dishes — also including meatless dishes or even vegan goulash. Nowadays some brewery restaurants even serve Alt beer. But all of them still have something in common: traditional Kölsch hospitality. As the New York Times once put it in an article about Cologne’s brewery-restaurant culture, “But drinking a Kölsch is more than just drinking a beer: it’s like drinking an entire culture.” Experience brewery culture live The top brewery restaurants at a glance Transcript",905

It’s time to go shopping at the weekly open-air market — which offers small delicacies at its street food stands and pleasant get-togethers after work. Cologne’s Meet & Eat concept market combines a variety of urban ideas — and livens up the urban scene. It’s surprising, meaningful and vital. When and where? Every Thursday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the Rudolfplatz behind the Hahnentorburg. This is a playground for the many foodies and people hungry for new experiences who enjoy this three-way market happening, which consists of a shopping experience, street & gourmet food and a weekly open-air market. Come join us! Unusually diverse, with excellent organic ratings Vietnamese spring rolls, Brussels waffles, Argentinian empanadas, vegan surprises and organic steaks — there are probably few other places where so many different dishes and national cuisines are gathered together in one small space. At this street food market in Cologne, you can find specialities from Italy, Peru, Brazil, Turkey, France and Austria as well as products from Spain, Asia, Tunisia and the Cologne region. Roofed-over benches and tables enable visitors to eat and drink in comfort in every kind of weather. Incidentally, in line with the basic concept, alcoholic drinks are served only in combination with food, snacks and prepared dishes. That’s because here the idea of lively interactions in a marketplace has precedence over insobriety. So if you want a second Kölsch after your meal, you’ll have to ask someone to bring it along for you. As a rule, alcoholic drinks can be ordered only together with food. Unconventional? Yes. Like the entire Meet & Eat market. Cologne’s after-work market for working people The idea behind Meet & Eat was to create a positive response to modern social developments. Working people usually do their shopping in the afternoon or evening. No regular open-air market is open this late. Eating out will soon make up the same share of household spending as buying food to prepare at home. And an open and informal meeting point for pleasant interactions at the heart of the city is a permanent requirement for many Cologne residents anyhow. Voilà: Meet & Eat combines business with pleasure. That’s very urban, don’t you think?

In Cologne you can expect to experience a unique and varied food and dining culture that’s distributed across all of its neighbourhoods, ranging from Kölsch brewery restaurant culture with Rhineland Sauerbraten to temples of gourmet cuisine. Equally colourful are the events that enliven the city every year in connection with ColognePride . There are usually more than 100 events, during which the LGBTQIA+ community demonstrates its right to tolerance and peaceful coexistence. You may be wondering why this diversity is celebrated in Cologne in particular. It’s probably because diversity is a genuine part of our city. Cologne is home to people from 180 different nations and a bastion of gay and lesbian life. About 9% of its residents have a disabled person’s pass, and all of its age groups are growing at an equal pace. And because diversity is simply more fun. R estaurants From rustic to sensuous — from elegant to wood-panelled In more than 1,000 restaurants, Cologne’s chefs have created a flourishing gourmet and connoisseurs’ scene in this metropolis on the Rhine. The spectrum ranges from hearty dishes accompanied by a neat glass of Kölsch beer in one of Cologne’s brewery restaurants or a local neighbourhood pub to multi-star restaurants, innovative tastings at food happenings and the little restaurant around the corner. This unique culinary scene is also extraordinarily friendly — and it will certainly be the home of one of your favourite restaurants.

What makes it different from other big cities? Let’s put it this way: Cologne is colourful, friendly and open, cosy and relaxed — not so much “on show” but rather more “backstage”. That’s partly due to the city’s size: it offers a vast array of experiences and evening events, but most of them are located only a stone’s throw apart. That makes it easy to plan an eventful evening.

Cologne,https://www.cologne-tourism.com/experiences-lifestyle/carnival,1,"Carnival 2026 in Cologne: All about Fastelovend | Cologne Tourist Board To content Search What are you looking for? Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking Carnival in Cologne Kölle alaaf! From pub to pub — in the open air: when the drum beats… When is Carnival? During the six days between Weiberfastnacht — the Women’s Carnival — and Veilchendienstag — Violet Tuesday — the revellers, who are known as Jecken, come out in force to celebrate Carnival, which is also known as the “fifth season” of the year. As the saying has it, on Ash Wednesday it’s all over — but in the meantime, Cologne is turned upside down all over again every year. In fact, the street Carnival actually starts in the Alter Markt (Old Market) at 11:11 a.m. on Thursday — Weiberfastnacht — and continues until the evening of Violet Tuesday. The Street Carnival in Cologne is a unique folk festival in the Rhineland that casts its spell over millions of visitors year after year. If you travel here to enjoy the age-old traditions of smooching and swaying, you’re in good hands in the Carnival stronghold of Cologne with its 480 Carnival associations. The most important dates of the session Weiberfastnacht : Thursday, 12 February 2026 Carnival Friday : Friday, 13 February 2026 Carnival Saturday : Saturday, 14 February 2026 Carnival Sunday : Sunday, 15 February 2026 Rose Monday : Monday, 16 February 2026 Violet Tuesday : Tuesday, 17 February 2026 Ash Wednesday : Wednesday, 18 February 2026 Start of the session 2026/2027 : Wednesday, 11 November 2026 Stunksitzung Events at a glance All info on street carnival FAQ 5 crazy days — from Weiberfastnacht to Violet Tuesday The Street Carnival officially begins on Thursday — Weiberfastnacht, or the Women’s Carnival. In many neighbourhoods throughout the city, celebrations involve handing over the keys. Many companies throw their own Carnival parties, shops stay closed, and costumed celebrants flock to celebrate in their associations, favourite pubs or with friends. The fun starts in the early morning and continues until late at night in the Altstadt (Old Town) and the popular Südstadt district. If you’re wearing a tie, prepare for the worst: The tradition of “crazy women” cutting off men’s ties is still flourishing. The first Carnival parade marches through Cologne's old town on Weiberfastnacht. Street Carnival: sessions and parades Most of the Carnival sessions are held on Carnival Friday — and so are the traditional parades of Cologne’s local Carnival associations, which converge in the city centre. Here the Carnival artists celebrate until the late evening. On Saturday morning, the Carnival association “Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823” stages its “Funkenbiwak” open-air session on the Neumarkt (New Market). If you buy a “Funkenstange” beer glass, you can have it filled up with Kölsch at one of the beer stands free of charge. Some of the Veedelszüge — the smaller local Carnival parades — are held in the various neighbourhoods on Saturday. Geisterzug, Veedelzüge, school parades at the weekend The famous Geisterzug, or “ghost parade”, is held on Saturday evening - one week before Carnival. It’s an alternative Carnival parade with political overtones that you can join spontaneously, as a figure of gloom or a brightly shining spirit. There’s no need to register beforehand! The route changes every year, depending on the annual theme. It’s been part of the Street Carnival in Cologne since 1991, but this tradition goes back even further, to 1860. Tulip Sunday features more school parades and Veedelszüge (local parades) as well as more Carnival sessions with humorous speeches, singing and good cheer. If you think no one could possibly manage so much celebration, you’ll be surprised: it’s incredible how much enthusiasm Carnival generates in Cologne!

This carnival parade, which passes through Cologne city centre, is considered one of the largest parades in Germany. And being part of it is everything. The parade has been rolling since 1823 - with floats, foot groups, dance groups and music bands - led by the ""Blaue Funken"" in the Cologne tradition. With a length of around 8 kilometres, the Rosenmontag parade covers a larger distance than its route. Around 300 tonnes of sweets change the owner here in a perfect throwing technique - and around 300,000 ""Strüßjer"" (flowers) express their affection. The highlight and end of the parade are also certain: the moment when ""D'r Prinz kütt"" (""The Prince arrives""). Violet Tuesday : neighbourhood parades and burning the Nubbel On the last day of the Street Carnival, the biggest neighbourhood parades march through Nippes, Ehrenfeld and Mülheim, with up to 200,000 enthusiastic spectators lining the sidewalks. The evening ceremony of burning the Nubbel, a scarecrow-like figure stuffed with straw, in front of many pubs marks the end of the “fifth season”. He’s a scapegoat who takes all the excesses of the Carnival season with him as he burns down into ashes and restores the celebrants to a state of innocent forgetfulness. Isn’t that lucky! Street Carnival facts and figures : did you know? As a social phenomenon and an economic factor, Carnival means more than colorful costumes and joyful celebrations. For example, over 100 Carnival associations work together in the Cologne Carnival festival committee to organize the “crazy days” of the Street Carnival. During an average parade, 330,000 kilogrammes of sweets, 700,000 chocolate bars and 220,000 boxes of pralines rain down on the enthusiastic spectators. Kölle alaaf! FAQ What is the theme for the 2026 carnival season? The theme of the 2026 Cologne Carnival season is ""ALAAF - Mer dun et för Kölle"" (ALAAF - We do it for Cologne). All information When does the Cologne street carnival begin? The street carnival begins on Weiberfastnacht (12 February 2026), which is the Thursday before Rose Monday (16 February 2026). There is a traditional cycle of sessions, balls and parades that takes place until Violet Tuesday (17 February 2026). The people celebrate, sing and dance in various halls, restaurants and pubs. During this time, normal life is suspended throughout Cologne. Many public institutions are closed, and Prince Carnival rules. The most important dates of the session What does one shout during carnival in Cologne? “Helau” or “Alaaf”? The Cologne cheer is “Kölle Alaaf.” “Helau” is the cheer in Mainz and Düsseldorf and thus is never used in Cologne under any circumstances. What does “Alaaf” mean? “Kölle Alaaf” is the cheer of the carnival revellers. It is derived from a medieval toast: “All ab” (All-av). It more or less means “Cologne alone” or “Cologne over everything.” It’s the shortest imaginable declaration of love to Cologne. Why does the “Nubbel” get burned? The “Nubbel” is a straw-filled doll that serves as the scapegoat for all of the transgressions that the revellers have committed during the days of carnival. The associated torchlight processions are held in the night from Violet Tuesday to Ash Wednesday . Impressive Nubbel burnings take place next to St. Agnes Church, in Nippes, in Südstadt, in Kwartier Latäng and in the Old Town (Altstadt). What is a ""Bützje""? Bützjer are friendly pecks on the cheek, and they have nothing to do with real kissing. A Bützje is not a silly attempt to flirt with you; during carnival it is part of the tradition and happens all the time. K ö ll e a l aa f ! Transcript",1425

In the exhibition, high-performance projectors transform the original works into gigantic projections that immerse the viewer in a colourful world. The highly symbolic works reveal Kahlo's most intimate thoughts and dreams and offer an unadulterated insight into her emotional world.

Here, a harmony of light art and sounds opens up, accompanied by a narrator who picks up on Kahlo's emotional narrative style through original quotes. This event, which is characterised by transformation and reinterpretation, provides access to Kahlo's world that goes far beyond visual contemplation. It appeals not only to art lovers, but also to anyone who is enthusiastic about the interplay between history and modern technology.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking PDF Share Tourist Information Cologne Tourist information A premier address for guests from all over the world. Since 1955. It is said: from here you have the best view of the Cologne Cathedral. This was already true in 1955 when the building of the Tourist Information Cologne was constructed as the “House of Tourism” and it still applies today: after extensive modernization and more digitalization in guest consultations. We look forward welcoming you to Cologne and providing you with all the information you need – on sights, events, as well as culinary offerings and personal tips for your stay. The modern concept integrates contemporary informational habits with the stylistic charm of the '50s. Thus, listed elements stand alongside digital stations, conversation islands, and touchscreens as complements or alternatives to personal consultations and service in multiple languages. A cozy book and reading corner invites you to stay and browse before you head upstairs via the original '50s curved staircase to the “balcony with a view” where you also find the inspirational gift shop. From Touchscreen to Your Own Smartphone – or Analog Through a large interactive map or via one of the touchscreens at the counters, you can browse various route suggestions or use the experience planner for sights, events, dining tips, or hotels in the foyer. Everything can be transferred to your smartphone via QR code – for when you're on the go. This also works with regard to personal consultations at the counters. You can find answers to frequently asked questions about your stay in Cologne, such as “Where can I charge my phone?” in the FAQ – with various informational materials available classically in print on-site or as PDF for download. Centrally Located and Welcoming: Including Souvenir Shop on the 1st Floor with a View of the Cathedral Conveniently located in close proximity to the main train station , Cologne Cathedral , Hohe Strasse , and the old town , the Tourist Information at Kardinal-Höffner-Platz 1 offers you a perfect start for your visit: Get inspired here for your exciting stay in Cologne. But before you put your Cologne plans into action, don’t forget to take in the view from the window on the 1st floor of the main portal of the Cathedral. This is also where the CologneShop is located with Cologne souvenirs, brand, fan, and decorative items, as well as many accessories. A Little Journey Back to the Tourism of the '50s... Not only because of its listed architecture and interior design with mosaic columns, wall murals, and staircase does the Tourist Information stand as an exemplar of the '50s. As an institution it also reminds you of the years of progress and economic boom. After the austere post-war years, in the '50s and with the advent of the economic miracle, Germans slowly rediscovered their wanderlust: Dolce Vita instead of drudge work, guesthouses, and guest rooms instead of staying home. Besides tours on foot, by bike, or train to the seaside or the Black Forest, many people also returned to the Rhine metropolis of Cologne. The first point of contact was often just this house of tourism with its three golden crowns on the bay window – symbolically for the Three Wise Men, whose relics rest directly opposite in Cologne Cathedral. A lovely symbolic connection, don’t you think? House of Tourism from 1955 The building was erected in 1955 following the plans of the renowned Cologne architect Hans Joachim Lohmeyer, who was significantly involved in the city's reconstruction. The factual, simple facade, and functional design is typical of the 1950s architecture, as these buildings could be efficiently constructed and flexibly used for various offices. The old “traffic office” with its tourism department was destroyed in the war. The latest modernization with its new interior reminiscent of the 1950s has made the building not only touristic but also energetically fit for the future – everywhere if possible, in consideration of existing monument protection regulations.

Cologne,https://www.cologne-tourism.com/experiences-lifestyle/events/detail/stunksitzung,1,"Stunksitzung Cologne 2026: humour for the thinking man | Cologne Tourist Board To content Search What are you looking for? Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking PDF Share Stunksitzung Tip Custom/culture Since 1984 there’s been a cabaret-style alternative programme for celebrating Carnival In recent years, the Stunksitzung has featured “The rat and the mouse”, i.e. the Pope in bed with a cardinal; a sketch in which Bishop Walter Mixa describes Pope Benedict XVI as “the Lord’s weasel, as dumb as a roll of communion wafers”; and a crucifix labelled “Tünnes” (a traditional figure of fun in Cologne). Is this your kind of irreverent humour? If so, we recommend this alternative Carnival programme, because the Stunksitzung’s mockery of current social and political topics has lost none of its sharp satirical bite over the years. Definitely not a traditional “Prunksitzung”: the thinking man’s Carnival revue The Stunksitzung is an antidote to political correctness, and its impudence is legendary. It’s a cabaret show that’s the direct opposite of the numerous “Prunksitzungen” held during Carnival. Both kinds of events are fixed components of Cologne’s “fifth season”. If you’re not keen on the swaying and jollity of the traditional “Prunksitzungen” and prefer the kind of alternative entertainment that satirizes politicians, the German army, the Catholic Church and the Carnival associations such as the Rote Funken, the Stunksitzung belongs on your Carnival agenda. Be sure to buy your ticket well ahead of time and enjoy one of the many Stunksitzung performances during the months before the Street Carnival and pub Carnival  begin. The Stunksitzung ensemble: an alternative tradition The Stunksitzung ensemble was founded in 1983 and held its first session in 1984 — and many members of the original ensemble are still active today. The president of this event until 1995 was its co-founder Jürgen Becker, a renowned German cabaret artist also known as “Heinz the Iroquois”. He was succeeded by Biggi Wanninger in 1999. The house band that has played at the Stunksitzung since 1988 is the Köbes Underground. And since 1991 the event’s venue, to which the fans flock, has been the E-Werk in Cologne-Mülheim. Biting, ironic, critical: beyond old-fashioned jokes and marching-band music The programme takes jabs at international politics and dislikeable characters all over the globe, and it features typically sharp local sketches and artistic numbers. If you like to laugh and enjoy seeing comedians taking swipes at Cologne’s Carnival and its traditional programme, come to the Stunksitzung — there won’t be a dry eye in the house. Kölle alaaf!

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking PDF Share AMAZONIA - Photographs by SEBASTIÃO SALGADO Tip Exhibition Sebastião Salgado's photography exhibition in Cologne for the first time Until mid-March 2026, the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum will be the first institution in Germany to present the internationally renowned exhibition ‘AMAZONIA - Photographs by Sebastião Salgado’. The photographic documentation by the Brazilian photographer focuses on the Amazon region, the largest tropical rainforest region on our planet, and in particular on those people who have been in direct contact with their natural environment for generations. Around 200 masterful black and white photographs paint a vivid picture of landscapes and ways of life, while at the same time revealing the complexity of the interplay between nature and society. Salgado's approach is empathetic and reflective: Authentic interviews with indigenous leaders provide deep insights into the social realities and ecological challenges of the rainforest and its inhabitants. In an immersive staging, accompanied by a specially composed sound installation by French composer Jean-Michel Jarre, the show invites visitors to recognise the sensitive balance of the Amazon region anew and to critically question their own role in terms of global responsibility. Salgado's profound documentation thus calls for a holistic view that combines ecological awareness with ethical reflection.

The exhibition ‘KOLLWITZ NEU SEHEN’ honours the 80th anniversary of the artist's death and the 40th anniversary of the museum. With a new hanging and the integration of previously unknown works, the multifaceted nature of Kollwitz' creative work is once again brought to the fore. Particular attention will be paid to the artist's female and socially critical perspectives. The omnipresence of social inequality and gender-specific challenges is thematised - aspects that moved Kollwitz and are still relevant today. Visitors are given impressive access to the concerns, hopes and solidarity that Kollwitz conveys through the expressiveness of her art.

Or you can visit the Zoo and the Flora botanical garden, cross the Rhine in a cable car and walk back along the right bank, crossing the Rhine again to the Cathedral via the Hohenzollernbrücke with its load of “love locks” weighing many tonnes.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours KölnCard Booking Gastronomy in Cologne Cuisine, drinking culture and going out — Cologne is casual in so many areas of life, and that’s especially true when it comes to creature comforts. The city’s brewery restaurants naturally have a long tradition in this regard. Cologne’s typical brewery restaurant culture makes it uniquely sociable and unconventional — even outside the Carnival season. Cologne’s vibrant restaurant scene has something to offer for every personality and every taste. It’s energized by more than 1,000 different restaurants, over 100 bars, over 700 pubs and more than ten starred restaurants, as well as several food festivals and happenings. The bills of fare range from vegan to hearty, from home cooking to gourmet dining, and from Kölsch beer to creative cocktails. Taste it — and love it. Breweries Top Gastronomy Bars Offer at a glance Brewery restaurants Kölsch, Köbes, cameraderie and a hearty meal: Brewery restaurants have been symbols of Kölsch tradition and culture for more than 500 years. Some things don’t change. And that’s good news, especially with regard to Cologne’s brewery restaurant culture. When the Köbes comes by with his round tray of Kölsch beer and the Sauerbrauten is steaming on the table, you know the city’s traditions and history are alive and well. That’s when things get snug and cosy, and that’s how it ought to be. In a brewery restaurant, everyone’s encouraged to chat and clink glasses with everyone else — with a Kölsch beer, which is a little bit different depending on the brewery, but always brewed according to the German Purity Law passed in 1516. You can hear more about this history if you join a brewery restaurant tour, for example. After sampling the food and drink of the various restaurants, quite a few people discover their favourite brewery restaurant for many happy returns — whether it’s near the Cathedral, in Friesenstraße or in the Altstadt (Old Town).

Car drivers who want to go from one zone to another can do so via the Leopold II-laan, the Van Iseghemlaan, the Visserskaai or the Vindictivelaan. These measures will prevent unnecessary traffic by those seeking their way about, while ensuring everyone gets to their destination in the city centre in an easier and faster way.

The artist speaks to you via augmented reality . In celebration of the James Ensor Year, he not only speaks directly to the audience, but some of his characteristic masks are also available as Instagram filters. Case Maclaim was the perfect street artist to create a portrait of James Ensor - based on his famous 'Self-portrait with masks' from 1899, but including the white 'smiley' that often returns in Case Maclaim's portraits.

Use your camera towards the artwork to 'scan' the wall. Turn on your sound and enjoy the experience: the artwork will move and Ensor will speak to you (with real audio clips of Ensor himself). Try it with Facebook Try it with Instagram About Case Maclaim Up until Case Maclaim got involved, street art was characterised by a rather cartoonish style with bold typography. At the end of the 20th century, the German artist and his Ma’Claim Crew put a startling end to that. In fact, today Maclaim is seen as the godfather of (photo)realistic street art , as the guy who erased the line between graffiti and painting. In short, the perfect street artist to create a portrait of James Ensor – based on his illustrious 1899 Self-Portrait with Masks , but featuring the white ‘smiley face’ that often recurs in Case Maclaim’s portraits.

What do they hope to find or feel there? The allure is timeless. Artists try to capture that feeling – their own longing, but that of others too. Ostend expanded to become the ‘Queen of Seaside Resorts’ in the 19th century and is still the place where many Belgians go to encounter the sea today. Both the E40 and the longest IC train in the country lead to it. Mu.ZEE plays a special role in this city by the sea: the museum focuses on art in Belgium from 1880 until tomorrow. The exhibition It’s Sunday at sea! is not just about the appearance of the sea but, above all, what it means to people. The sea is both relaxing and spectacular. It can bring peace but also be overwhelming. Artists sometimes show it as it is, in the open. At other times, they recall it from memory, in dreamscapes or symbols. The sea gives rise to reflection and imagination. An important source of inspiration for the exhibition is the 1899 poem Vers la mer by Émile Verhaeren. This runs like a thread through the exhibition and connects the beginning of Mu.ZEE’s collection – around 1880 – with the present day. From artists such as Ensor and Spilliaert to contemporary names such as Lili Dujourie. Dujourie’s work Il fait dimanche sur la mer! takes its name from a line in Verhaeren’s poem. It shows the sea as it is seen from an apartment with a ‘view of the sea’ – a dream for many. Seven screens show one day of the week each, captured on video. What can you see? As a visitor, you are free to make up your own mind. Everyone’s experience of the sea is different. The title It’s Sunday at sea! sounds cheerful and inviting – Stefan Zweig even translates it as Sunday celebration. But perhaps it also evokes another feeling, such as the languor or stillness of a Sunday. Discover what the sea means to you in the exhibition itself. About Mu.ZEE breezes out In January 2025, Mu.ZEE closed the doors of its well-known main building in Romestraat, Ostend for three years as part of an extensive renovation. During this period, Mu.ZEE will remain active, not only in its own Permekemuseum in Jabbeke and Peiremuzee in Knokke-Heist, but also in the form of exhibitions in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Drogenbos and Koksijde. In Ostend itself, during the closure Mu.ZEE has taken up residence in the stately Venetian Galleries, designed by Henri Maquet and built between 1900 and 1903. Here Mu.ZEE shows the very best of itself, that is to say: art in Belgium from 1880 until tomorrow that speaks to the imagination. On the Ostend promenade overlooking the sea, parts of the Mu.ZEE collection are on display in three areas. The gallery offers space for four consecutive thematic exhibitions, of which It’s Sunday at sea! is the first. In the large hall, next to the gallery, the focus is on one work, artist, archive or ensemble. Lastly, at the back, an active depot offers a glimpse behind the scenes of museum operations and a fascinating collection. In a permanent experimental installation, Mu.ZEE is also examining and showing the influence of light on various materials for three years, thus reflecting on presentations after the reopening of Mu.ZEE in 2028. A brand new exhibition scenography for this temporary home was designed by Theo De Meyer, Laura Muyldermans and Yuichiro Onuma.

The combination of historic locations, the multi-faceted collections and how interwoven they are with Bruges' rich history speak to everyone's imagination. On squares So many squares, so many different vibes. They are regularly the backdrop for an unforgettable concert or a lively event. From the spectacular to intimate and cozy: As the largest square in Bruges, 't Zand Square is the event venue par excellence in the historic centre. Market Square and Burg Square stand shoulder to shoulder in the heart of Bruges, and stand out with their majestic character. The courtyard of the Gruuthuse Museum is more intimate, but at the same time makes an impression with the 15th-century Gruuthuse Palace and the 115.5-meter tower of the Church of Our Lady as a breath-taking backdrop. For those looking to put their dancing shoes on, the Fish Market is the place to be in the summer. In parks In nice weather, nothing beats the nice vibe of a park. The calming greenery, the tweeting birds and the sound of music: in Bruges' city parks you will often stumble across a stage, a tent or something similar. Festivals, concerts and get-togethers with friends, family or colleagues are even more fun in the park: The Cactus Festival descends on the Minnewaterpark every summer. Every spring, Koning-Albert-I park is filled with funfair attractions. Koningin Astridpark , a stone's throw from Burg Square , is also a familiar presence in the local event landscape. Music in a religious heritage setting It's not just in streets, squares and parks that the sound of music floats on the air. Various churches also regularly open their doors for concerts. For example, St Saviour's Cathedral has for decades been inviting Belgian and foreign organists to dazzle with their talents on the centuries-old organ at the cathedral concerts. Soloists find themselves on a unique concert stage in the Beguinage Church and St James’s Church . Concerts are also regularly organised in the baroque St Walburga's Church , the neo-Gothic St Magdalene's Church , the Ryelandt Hall in a former Theresian convent and the classical chapel of Hof Bladelin . It's a feast for your ears, but also for your eyes. Carillon concerts It's impossible to imagine Bruges without Carillons . Their harmonious chimes set the rhythm of the city and the carillonneurs are veritable musical wizards. Every week, they play the at least 23 bronze bells with the keyboard. A carillon concert is unforgettable, and enchanting. The instrument and the Belgian tradition have been granted special recognition from UNESCO . Don't miss this unique experience. Outside the city centre From white beach to picturesque polder village, Bruges has it all. These unique settings are also the ideal backdrop to special events. Bomboclat, WeCanDance and Film op het Strand take up Zeebrugge 's beach every summer, the largest beach on the Belgian coast. Elsewhere, charming Lissewege lends its nostalgic vibe to an artistic Beeldenroute and the enchanting Festival of Light, every summer. Enjoy culture outside the city centre.

No evening tours are offered, so as not to disturb the peace of those living along the water. From mid-November through February, the boat companies can decide for themselves whether to open or not, and at what times. Are there several routes to choose from? Tours are permitted on parts of the Bruges canals. All the boat companies take the same route between Jan van Eyck Square and the Beguinage . On the way, you can admire several of Bruges' highlights.

The tour of Bruges' canals takes half an hour without any stops. Longer boat trips are not possible. What if it rains? The boats are not covered. In the event of (sudden) rain, umbrellas will be handed out. If it rains hard for a long time, the boat companies may decide to suspend the boat trips after a while, or they will not open at all. This decision will be taken by the boat companies themselves. In what languages is an explanation given during the boat trip? The boat's captain will give an explanation during the voyage through a microphone. The languages in which the explanations are provided will depend on the nationalities on board and so may vary from one tour to another. At the start of the boat trip, the skipper will ask which languages the visitors speak and based on that he/she will decide in what language or languages the explanation will be given during the boat trip. Most captains are fluent speakers of Dutch, French and English. Some of them also speak some German and/or Spanish. Will I see any swans while sailing on the canals? There are a hundred or so swans on Bruges' canals. They can move freely on the water and are used to the boats. They will move aside themselves when a boat is approaching. Both Bruges' skippers and the passengers on board are expected to show respect for Bruges' swans. The animals have been swimming on Bruges' waters for centuries, which is why they are cherished by the residents of Bruges. The swans are cared for by City of Bruges staff. There are a great many swans roaming around on the water and the banks at the Bakkersrei, next to the Beguinage , as this is the only feeding spot in the city centre. The boat is a good place to get a view of Bruges' swans here. Useful to know: in the winter, the swans are taken out of the water and moved to a covered winter residence, where they even have their own swimming pool. The swans are also transferred to their winter residence for preventative reasons when an infectious bird flu is circulating. Are the boat trips child friendly? There is no offering tailored to children. As to the route and onboard explanation, the boat trip is not tailored to children, but the experience of a boat trip in itself is something children will enjoy: coming aboard, sailing on the canals, sometimes being sprayed by water, the swans on the way, waving to people on the shore, ducking for a low bridge. What does a boat trip in Bruges cost and are there any discounts? The pricing for a boat trip for individual visitors can be viewed higher up this web page. In addition, there are a range of discount rates: €12.00 for groups from 20 people €9.00 for children aged between 4 and 11 (including in a group or school capacity) and people with a disability when showing their 'European Disability Card' free guides for people with a disability when showing the 'European Disability Card' and supervisors of groups or school classes. The pricing is determined by the City of Bruges. Can I book online in advance for a boat trip in Bruges? Booking online for individual visits is not possible. You simply buy your ticket on the spot from one of the shipping companies. Please allow for some waiting time during busy periods. From 20 people, you can book at one of the five embarkation points. You can also book a private boat in advance. Can I hire a private boat to sail on the Bruges canals and, if so, how do I book a private boat? It is possible to hire a private boat in Bruges. A private boat means that no passengers other than your company will be on the boat. Small groups can book a private boat, as well as individual visitors. For example, if you desire a boat trip for a special occasion, such as a romantic wedding proposal or for an unforgettable birthday. You can book a private boat in advance with one of the five boat companies: Boat company Venetië van het Noorden, Huidenvettersplein 13, tel. +32 50 33 00 41, jos.boot@skynet.be Boat company Coudenys, Rozenhoedkaai, tel. +32 50 33 13 75, info@coudenys.com Boat company De Meulemeester, Wollestraat 32, tel. +32 50 33 41 20, rondvaarten.de.meulemeester@skynet.be Boat company Gruuthuse, Nieuwstraat 11, tel. +32 50 33 32 93, info@bootex.be , http://www.boottochten-brugge.be Boat company Stael, Katelijnestraat 4, tel. +32 50 3 327 71, boten@nvstael.com The price for a private boat trip on the Bruges canals can be worked out yourself. Irrespective of the number of passengers on the private boat, you will pay the individual price for adults (see further up this web page) times 30 with all the boat companies. How do I book a boat trip for a group? From 20 people, you can book a boat trip with one of the five boat companies: Boat company Venetië van het Noorden, Huidenvettersplein 13, tel. +32 50 33 00 41, jos.boot@skynet.be Boat company Coudenys, Rozenhoedkaai, tel. +32 50 33 13 75, info@coudenys.com Rederij De Meulemeester, Wollestraat 32, tel. +32 50 33 41 20, rondvaarten.de.meulemeester@skynet.be Boat company Gruuthuse, Nieuwstraat 11, tel. +32 50 33 32 93, info@bootex.be , http://www.boottochten-brugge.be Boat company Stael, Katelijnestraat 4, tel. +32 50 3 327 71, boten@nvstael.com The price amounts to €12.00 per person for groups from 20 people. Children aged between 4 and 11 will pay €9.00. Supervisors for groups or school classes may sail for free. How can I pay for the boats? You pay on the spot with the boat company, with Payconiq or cash. There are several cash machines near the embarkation points. The boat company may ask for a deposit for bookings for groups or a private boat. For groups or a private boat trip, you should ask the boat companies about the way to pay. Are all the boats the same? Certain matters, such as width and length, are all fixed and are determined by the municipal authorities. The boat companies need to adhere to these. In practice, therefore, the boat companies all sail with the same boats. Are the boats wheelchair accessible? Neither the boats nor the embarkation points are wheelchair accessible. All the locations are at water level. This means that you will need to take some stairs down below. There is no lift. Those who are still mobile enough to cover short distances and board a boat themselves (possibly aided by their own supervisor) are best to travel with boat company Stael. This embarkation point has the fewest stairs. Katelijnestraat 4 tel. +32 50 3 327 71 boten@nvstael.com Are the boats environmentally friendly? There are five boat companies in Bruges, each of which has four boats. The Bruges fleet therefore has 20 boats in total. As early as 2010, there was an initial test project with an electric boat. The current e-boats have been sailing on the canals since 2020: at present, there are two of these electric tour boats for each boat company. This means that half of the fleet is electric. The remaining boats will be replaced by more environmentally conscious models in phases. This is how the boat trips in Bruges will be made sustainable. The e-boats produce no emissions, there is no odour pollution, they make less noise and cause fewer waves. How many passengers can come along on a boat? The boats have a capacity of 35 to 40 people. Where does the name ‘reien' (canals) come from? Bruges' canals have a special name that you will hear nowhere else in the world: 'reien', also affectionately known as 'reitjes'. The designation ‘Bruges' reien’ derives from a little river that flows through Bruges: the Reie. Bruges owes much of its existence and prosperity to this river and the connection it used to have with the sea. Partly through the water, trade and the city flourished centuries ago. The Reie has seen much adaptation by humans down the centuries, but the route can always be recognised in the waterways. The river flows into the city through the Lake of Love and crosses through the city from south to north, through the Groenerei to the Damme Gate. When you take a boat trip in Bruges, much of it will involve sailing across this river. Do you want to know more about Bruges and the water? Download the free Visit Bruges Route App and follow the walk ' The story of Bruges '. Visit the City Hall at Burg Square and see in augmented reality the full history of Bruges' connection to the sea. How many swans are swimming on the canals and where exactly are they? There are a hundred or so swans on Bruges' canals. The population fluctuates from year to year. They can move freely on the water and eat the water plants. Alongside the Beguinage , on Bakkersrei and at Wijngaardplein , however, you will always find some swans. This is where they get a supplement to their natural diet, and they can eat mixed grain to their heart’s content. Every so often, the carers give them some extras. Lettuce, spinach or endives provide a lot of vitamins! City of Bruges staff provide care for Bruges swans. How deep are Bruges' canals? Bruges' canals are not that deep. On average, the canals have a depth of around 2 metres. Less, in some places. For example, you can see the bottom on the Kapucijnenrei next to Concertgebouw Brugge (Concert Hall) in good weather. At the Coupure close to the lock, however, the water is deeper – around 4 metres. Along the Dijver, an adult man can stand in the water, which would then come to chest height. Can I hire a boat myself to sail on Bruges' canals? It is not possible to hire a boat in Bruges and sail it on the waters yourself. No boats are rented out that you can sail without a sailing licence. There are only guided tours of the canals from one of the five jetties. Sailing with your own canoe, paddle-boarding or rowing is not permitted either. Can you swim in the canals? In the summer months, a swimming platform is constructed along the Predikherenrei, in the Coupure . The water quality is tested in advance and, if there is a good result, the swimming platform will open and you can swim in Bruges' canals in the open air. There is a recreational swimming area for some crazy water fun and a sporting swimming area where you can do laps. For the little ones, a small paddling pool about 10 centimetres deep has been provided. There are some changing rooms, showers, toilets and a First Aid room. There are lifeguards supervising the entire swimming area. Swimming in the canals is free and you do not need to book. Can I bring my dog along for the boat trip? This depends upon the size of your dog. It is therefore best to ask the shipping company about this in advance, when you buy your ticket. Small dogs can be brought along on your lap. Can I bring any luggage aboard the boats? No space has been provided for luggage on the boats. No lockers or storage facilities have been provided at the boat companies. In the centre, you will find some left luggage facilities at the Historium on the Market Square. You can also leave your luggage in a locker at the railway station . A handbag or small rucksack can be brought on board, however. Can I leave a pram behind at the embarkation point? Before embarking, you can ask the boat company to put the pram to one side. Do bear in mind that there are no storage facilities or lockers. Depending on which boat company you choose, the pram may or not be in the open air. Can I eat or drink anything on the boat?

To replace the museum, a new exhibition about the life of Anselm Adornes is opening in the Pieterszalen. His life as a knight, merchant, diplomat and pilgrim can be described as multifaceted, to say the least. In the exhibition, you will discover the impressive family tree of the Adornes dynasty, from Anselm to the current owners, Count and Countess de Limburg Stirum. Anselm Adornes was a prominent figure in Bruges. He became extremely wealthy thanks to the alum trade, was a formidable opponent in knightly tournaments and was a cunning diplomat for the Dukes of Burgundy. A devout man, he fulfilled his dream journey: a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Today, we find his tangible legacy in the Adornes estate: the Jerusalem Chapel.

In fact, you'll find this blissful spot just outside the centre of Bruges, along the inland waterway and in the shadow of the imposing bridge Katelijne Bridge. Despite its proximity to the outer ring road, you can relax here and hear the birds singing. The park is ideal for a picnic, a leisurely stroll through the greenery or to relax while the children have fun with the natural play elements. Especially on the waterfront of Katelijne Park, it's great to relax. You can sunbathe on the benches while pleasure boats and barges slowly pass you by.

The brushstrokes of these and other painters heralded a period of artistic flourishing for Bruges from the 15th century onwards. You can still admire their masterpieces in the city where they were once painted. The 15th-century St Ursula Shrine by Hans Memling in the Museum St John's Hospital. The photo shows a close-up of the reliquary. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet The seven works by Hans Memling | Museum St John's Hospital Flemish primitive Hans Memling (circa 1430/40-1494) produced his most important masterpieces in Bruges. The medieval St. John's Hospital preserves no fewer than seven of his works, four of which were commissioned by the hospital. Nowhere else in the world will you find so many of his works in their original location. A unique opportunity to admire a Flemish primitive in historical context. Church of the Museum St John's Hospital, with part of the contemporary artwork 'Reclining Arcangelo II' by Berlinde De Bruyckere in the foreground. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet 'Reclining Arcangelo II' by Berlinde De Bruyckere | Museum St John's Hospital In the centre of the former chapel of the mediaeval St John's Hospital, a fallen archangel rests on a tomb-like pedestal. The life-size figure in shades of black and grey was created especially for the museum by Berlinde De Bruyckere, one of the most important sculptors of recent decades. With her contemporary sculpture, she pays tribute to all caregivers, the angels of our time. 'Madonna with Child' by Michelangelo in the Church of Our Lady. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet Michelangelo's 'Madonna and Child' | Museum of the Church of Our Lady A world-class masterpiece in white marble.

A woman photographs the tomb of Mary of Burgundy in the Church of Our Lady. © Visit Bruges | Jan D'Hondt The mausoleum of Mary of Burgundy and her father Charles the Bold | Museum of the Church of Our Lady The chancel of the Church of Our Lady houses two monumental tombs from the 15th and 16th centuries. They combine splendour, pomp and symbolism in a timeless tribute to two Burgundian sovereigns: Duchess Mary and her father Charles the Bold, both depicted with astonishing realism on their tombs. Painting 'The Seven Wonders of Bruges' 'The Seven Wonders of Bruges' | Gruuthuse Museum This 16th-century painting, attributed to Pieter I Claeissens, depicts a fantasy version of Bruges, with seven iconic buildings. The intention was probably to emphasise how pleasant the city was to visit, live in and do business in. Five of these buildings still exist today, including the Belfry and the Church of Our Lady. Which ones can you still recognise in today's cityscape? Visitors to the aldermen's chamber of the Liberty of Bruges admire the magnificent fireplace. © Visit Bruges | Jan D'Hondt The monumental Renaissance fireplace | Liberty of Bruges A hidden gem in the aldermen's chamber of the Liberty of Bruges.

For history enthusiasts Visitors to the oratory of the Gruuthuse Palace look through the windows into the Church of Our Lady. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet The oratory of a city palace | Gruuthuse Museum and Museum of the Church of Our Lady The Gruuthuse family unquestionably belonged to the elite of 15th-century Bruges. They had a luxurious residence built next to the Church of Our Lady. From a private chapel, the noble residents of the palace attended church services without leaving their home. Today, you can follow in their footsteps from centuries ago, in the authentic prayer chapel.

The Belfry, seen from Market Square. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet Climbing Bruges' most important tower | Belfry The Belfry has watched over Bruges for centuries. The building, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built in several phases between the 13th and 15th centuries.

Gothic hall of the City Hall. © Visit Bruges | Jan D'Hondt The Gothic hall | City Hall Bruges City Hall is one of the oldest in the Low Countries. Its monumental Gothic façade inspired the architects of the city halls in Brussels, Ghent and Leuven, and others. Inside, the Gothic hall leaves visitors speechless. Here in this spectacular venue, the newlyweds of Bruges say 'I do' to each other. Everything takes place under an impressive suspended vault, surrounded by colourful murals depicting the history of Bruges. Presentation 'Bruges and the sea', an AR model in the historic hall of the City Hall. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet Bruges and the sea | City Hall Bruges owes its origins, prosperity and wealth largely to its connection with the North Sea. An augmented reality model shows how the city remained connected to the North Sea via waterways — from Roman times to the present day. Ideal for anyone who loves to go on a historical journey through time.

Everything is still on display: authentic herb cabinets, weighing scales, jugs, pots and jars, and a long oak counter where the nuns of St John's Hospital prepared their medicines. For lovers of hidden gems House Gezelle Garden. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet An oasis of tranquillity and greenery | House Gezelle Garden Guido Gezelle (1830-1899) is one of Flanders' most famous poets and an important linguist from the Dutch-speaking region. His birthplace is a former 16 th -century gardener's house that has been converted into a museum . One of the star attractions is the extensive garden that adjoins the house. A place where you can immediately find serenity, with shaded spots and an organic vegetable garden. The Baroque interior of the Church of Our Lady of the Pottery. © Visit Bruges | Jan Darthet A sumptuous Baroque church interior | Museum of Our Lady of the Pottery Behind the modest façade of a centuries-old hospital building, you will discover a richly decorated Baroque church. It is definitely worth a detour, and you won't be the first. Since the 14 th century, people have been coming to this church from far and wide, to venerate a centuries-old miraculous statue. The 'Madonna and Child' on the high altar is one of the oldest statues in Bruges (late 13 th century).

Now only four remain, of which the Sint-Janshuis mill is the only original Bruges mill. With favourable wind, this 18 th -century baker's mill still grinds grain, and you can see the mill in operation. No wind?

The building, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built in several phases between the 13th and 15th centuries. This iconic symbol of Bruges' power, prosperity, and freedom in the Middle Ages has been a familiar feature in the city's skyline ever since. If you really want to experience the Belfry, climb the 366 steps to the top. Along the way, you can immerse yourself in the story of the 83-metre tower. At the top, you can look forward to breathtaking views of Bruges and its wide surroundings. History of the Belfry and City Halls When exactly the Belfry first appeared is unknown, but there was probably a wooden city hall with a tower on the Market Square by the early 13th century. It is thought that a stone version was erected in 1240, but a fire struck the building in 1280 and it was partially devoured by the flames. Bruges' residents began repairs almost immediately, and continued to expand the building in the 14th and 15th centuries. The tower grew higher and higher. Finally, between 1482 and 1486, the Belfry received its now familiar octagonal superstructure in Brabant sandstone, originally crowned with a wooden spire. The spire was lost in a fire shortly after completion. It was rebuilt and then destroyed again after a lightning strike in 1741. This is how the Belfry acquired its current silhouette in the 18th century. Two functions, one building The Belfry and the City Halls are inseparable, as the tower stands atop a wing of the hall complex. However, each had its own function: The Belfry was the repository of the city charters; official documents detailing the privileges and freedoms of the city's citizens. They were issued by the lord of the land and guaranteed the city a certain degree of autonomy and self-government. In exchange for this independence, Bruges provided financial and military support to its lord, the Count of Flanders. Other important charters, the city's seal and the coffers, were also safely stored in the Belfry's treasury. Because all these symbols of municipal power were deposited here, the tower itself became the icon of Bruges' prosperity and independence. In addition, the Belfry was: used to proclaim official messages, announcements and ordinances. The proclamation of these ""hall commandments"" by city officials was conducted from a small balcony just above the central entrance gate, on the Market Square side. an ideal watchtower. Guards in the tower kept a close eye on the city and its surroundings. At set times, they gave an ""all-safety"" signal with a horn or clarion. the home to dozens of city clocks. Bell chimes warned of danger, announced important events, and marked everyday moments, such as the opening and closing of the city gates. The City Halls were a covered marketplace where goods were stored and sold. By the 12th century, Bruges had become an international and dynamic trading city with a port. The Market Square was the commercial and economic heart, and the obvious central site for a market hall. With the construction of the City Halls, Bruges fulfilled the need to provide appropriate commercial infrastructure. What does ""belfry"" mean? In a medieval city, ""clock privilege"" was important as it allowed a city to structure daily life through bells. Some cities used church bells or hung their main city bells in a church tower. Other cities, such as Bruges, were wealthy enough to cast their own city bells and hang them in a separate tower, or city gate. A possible explanation for the word ""belfort ""can be found in the earliest bell towers. These probably resembled a 'bergfried' —  a wooden siege tower used during attacks. The Frankish word evolved into 'beffroi'  in French, from which the English 'belfry' is derived. Clocks, by the way, were often given names. Bruges' most important clock is called the triumphal clock or victory clock. It sounds only a few times a year at set times on special occasions . If you're in Bruges during one of those times, you might be lucky enough to hear the triumphal bell ringing! The Belfry as a UNESCO World Heritage Site Belfries are characteristic of Flanders, parts of Wallonia, and northern France. Each is unique and contributes to the identity of its city. Bruges residents are also particularly proud of their ""Hall Tower"". Since 1938 the building has been protected as a monument, and in 1999 Bruges' Belfry received international recognition. Bruges' Belfry is now on the UNESCO World Heritage List , along with 55 belfries in Belgium and France. This means that belfries have exceptional universal value for all humanity, and must be preserved and cherished for future generations. According to UNESCO, what makes belfries so special is that they are among the oldest examples of medieval civil and public architecture. They represent the pride, independence, and self-awareness of late medieval communities, as well as their wealth and power. What you'll see during your visit The Belfry tower is a municipal museum. A visit to Bruges' most famous tower is an unforgettable experience. During your climb up, you will pass four special rooms: The treasury room This is where the city charters, the city's seal, and the municipal treasury were once kept. You can still see how heavily these were secured: in iron boxes fitted with padlocks, and placed in niches behind double wrought-iron doors. The drum room An enormous drum weighing over 9,000 kilograms and pierced with 30,500 holes is the centrepiece here. Some holes are provided with a pin. When the large drum rotates, these pins automatically set different bells in motion. It's a bit like a giant music box. Then prick up your ears, and listen to the melody that sounds over the city. The tower room This is the workplace of the city carillonneur, who plays the 47 bells of the carillon on a keyboard. With hands and feet, the carillonneur can play four carillon bells simultaneously. By the way, did you know that Belgian carillon culture has also been recognised by UNESCO as a model safeguarding practice? The bell room Step into the bell room and enjoy breathtaking 360° views across Bruges, but brace yourself!  The mighty bronze bells ring out every quarter-hour with a powerful toll that echoes above your head. Don’t forget to protect your ears — and prepare for an unforgettable experience! If you prefer to keep your feet on the ground, you can admire the Belfry from the courtyard of the City Halls, surrounded by the hall complex with an excellent view of the tower. On the Market side of the building is a tactile model, ideal for a bird's-eye perspective of the complex. Today, the City Halls mainly host events and exhibitions. Virtual tour Feeling curious? Take a virtual peek into the treasure room and drum room , or check out the courtyard of the City Halls and the panorama from the tower beforehand.

Most stores open their doors from 10.00 a.m. and stay open until 6.00 or 6.30 p.m. Many stores are open on Sundays in any case, but every first Sunday of the month (excluding public holidays) is shopping Sunday in Bruges. More stores are open on this monthly shopping day than on other Sundays.

Low-traffic shopping streets Shopping is even more enjoyable in a low-traffic environment. That's why Bruges restricts and/or excludes traffic in certain shopping streets . This applies: Every day in the Steenstraat and Katelijnestraat, from 1.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. On Saturday and Sunday in the Zuidzandstraat, the Geldmuntstraat and the Noordzandstraat, between 1.00 p.m. and 6.00 p.m. Buses from De Lijn are authorised in the entire low-traffic zone. So visitors can still reach the city centre via public transport. Feedback Feedback",6495
