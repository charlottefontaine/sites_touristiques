The huge legendary sculpture has a diameter of 1.75 meters and is dedicated to the God of the Sea, represented by a male bearded face with holes for the eyes, nose and mouth . According to legend A husband who mistrusted his wife took her to the Mouth of Truth to test her faithfulness . The woman reacted by pretending to swoon and her lover caught her in his arms. After this, the woman swore before the Mouth of Truth that she had only been in the arms of her husband and of the man that had just caught her. This is just one of the many legends that exist regarding the famous sculpture that, with the passing of time, continues to generate enormous anticipation . Where is the Mouth of Truth? The sculpture was once located in the Piazza della Bocca della Verit\u00e1 until 1632. It was then\u00a0transferred to the outside of one of the walls of the nearby Santa Mar\u00eda in Cosmedin , the place where it remains today. It is very common to see large numbers of people lining up to be photographed with their hand inside the Mouth of Truth.

Book Tour The Capitoline Museums (Musei Capitolini) are found in Piazza del Campidoglio . The museums are owned and administered by the Municipality of Rome. The museum was\u00a0the result of the donation of a collection of valuable bronzes by Pope Sixtus IV in 1471 to the citizens of Rome, making them the oldest museums in the world. The museums are made up of two imposing buildings: the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the Palazzo Nuovo. Both mansions are linked by the Galleria Lapidaria, a tunnel that takes you under Piazza del Campidoglio without having to leave the museums. Palazzo dei Conservatori Opened to the public in 1734 under Pope Clement XII, the Palazzo dei Conservatori houses a collection including paintings, sculptures, busts of well-known people of that time, and other artwork by renowned artists like Caravaggio, Tiziano, Rubens, and Tintoretto. One of the main attractions found in this museum is the original sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf. The mansion also features the Ritratto di Carlo I d'Angi\u00f2 de Arnolfo di Cambio (1277), the first sculpture of a living person. One of the most striking parts of the building is a glass-covered hall. In the center is the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, originally displayed in the Piazza del Campidoglio. In this wing, fragments of several colossal statues are preserved. Palazzo Nuovo The Palazzo Nuovo is devoted primarily to the exhibition of statues, sculptures, mosaics, and busts. Some of these are Roman replicas of Greek originals. Among the museum\u2019s greatest works is the Capitoline Venus, a marble sculpture designed between 100 and 150 AD. Other famous works of art include the Discobolus and the statue of Dying Gaul. In the Hall of the Philosophers, visitors will find remarkable busts of Greek and Roman philosophers. These portraits had previously decorated the gardens and villas of the Roman aristocrats. Worth exploring Located in the heart of the city, the two palaces that make up the Capitoline Museums offer an impressive collection of Roman paintings and sculptures, leaving visitors speechless.

Learn the myth behind this tradition and learn about its history . Book your tour Trevi Fountain is the most beautiful fountain in Rome . Measuring some 20 meters in width by 26 meters in height, Trevi Fountain is also the largest fountain in the city . The origins of the fountain go back to the year 19 B.C., in which period the fountain formed the end of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct . The first fountain was built during the Renaissance, under the direction of Pope Nicholas V. The final appearance of the Trevi Fountain dates from 1762, when\u00a0after many years of works at the hand of Nicola Salvi, it was finalized by Giuseppe Pannini. Interestingly enough, the name of Trevi derives from Tre Vie (three ways) , since the fountain was the meeting point of three streets. The myth of the Trevi Fountain Why are there always people in the fountain throwing coins into the water and taking photos of themselves? The myth, originating in 1954 with the movie \" Three Coins in the Fountain ,\" goes like this: If you throw one coin: you will return to Rome . If you throw two coins: you will fall in love with an attractive Italian. If you throw three coins: you will marry the person that you met. In order to achieve the desired effect, you should throw the coin with your right hand over your left shoulder. An interesting statistic is that approximately a million euros worth of coins are taken from the fountain each year . Since 2007 this money has been used to support good causes . The most beautiful fountain in the world For us Trevi Fountain is the most beautiful fountain in the world . Whether under daylight or warmly lit up at night, the fountain is never lonely. One thing that can dampen the mood is that the area is full of people trying to sell roses in a pushy way, but simply ignoring them is enough to be able to continue enjoying such a special place.

        "text":"Piazza Navona - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Piazzas and fountains Piazza Navona Defined during the fifteenth century, the Baroque-style Piazza Navona is one of the most charming and popular squares in Rome . The public square is built on the site where the Stadium of Domitian (Circus Agonalis), founded in 86 AD,\u00a0once stood. It could hold approximately 20,000 spectators, which came here to see different athletic competitions. Fountains of Piazza Navona The most beautiful parts of Piazza Navona are its three fountains, designed during the papacy of Gregory XIII : Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Erected in the centre of Piazza Navona, the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers) was designed by Bernini in 1651 . The four statues represent the most important rivers of the continents where Christianity had spread; the Nile, Danube, the Ganges and Rio de la Plata. In the middle there is an obelisk measuring 52 ft (16 m), which had originally been part of the Circus of Maxentius, found in the Appian Way Regional Park. Fontana del Moro Sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and later perfected by Bernini, who added the figure of the Moor, the fountain was initially called the \u201cSeashell Fountain.\u201d This fountain is located on the southern side of the square. Fontana del Nettuno The Fontana del Nettuno (Fountain of Neptune) was also created by Giacomo della Porta in 1574 , but remained unfinished for approximately three-hundred years, until 1878, when it was decorated by Antonio Della Bitta and Gregorio Zappal\u00e0. Interesting facts Until mid-nineteenth century, every summer the drains of the three fountains were blocked and the centre of the square was flooded to make the \u201cLake of Piazza Navona\u201d . It was greatly enjoyed by the locals. A charming area The square is surrounded by restaurants and terraces giving Piazza Navona a lively and delightful atmosphere during the day. Here, visitors can enjoy performances by street artists like magicians and dancers. The most imposing buildings which look onto the square are the Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone and the Palazzo Pamphilj.

        "text":"Our Lady of the Conception - The Crypt of the Capuchins, Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Our Lady of the Conception Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins (Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini), erected between 1626 and 1631, was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII. It is one of the most uncommon churches in Rome thanks to its unusual crypt. Interior The interior of this small church stands out because of its bare walls and discreet decoration, which contrasts greatly with the majority of the temples in Rome and their ostentatious ornaments. However, this is not what makes it so special. The main appeal of Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins is found in the church\u2019s crypt, where many visitors will feel a chill down their spines as soon as they walk down to the ossuary. The Capuchin Crypt After the church was finished in 1631, Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin friars, ordered that the remains of the members of his order be moved from the cemetery to the church\u2019s crypt. The bones were to be placed on the walls in a specific way, creating different motifs and designs full of religious symbolism, a site where the friars would come to reflect and pray. The crypt is divided into six pocket-sized chapels, decorated with the bones of 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870. The effect is as shocking as it is macabre. As well as the walls covered in individual bones, the chapels also house truly chilling\u00a0whole skeletons dressed with the Capuchin brown habit. Despite what it might seem, the ossuary is an imaginative cult for the dead, which\u00a0only seeks to demonstrate that the body merely contains the soul. Very popular The church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini is usually unnoticed by the crowds of tourists who seek to explore the macabre crypt and its d\u00e9cor of skeletons. Although this is a very unusual and unforgettable experience, it might\u00a0be unsuitable for overly sensitive people.

        "text":"Film and TV in Rome - Famous tv shows and films Civitatis Rome General Information Film and TV in Rome Thanks to its long history , reflected in its present, Rome has been one of the most-filmed cities in the world throughout the years.

Films and TV Series Set in Rome Roman Holiday: As you might guess by the title, you can explore pretty much every scene in the film, just by passing through the city. Directed by William\u00a0Wyler and with lead acting by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck ,\u00a0it includes the Mouth of Truth in one of the most iconic scenes in classic cinema.

La dolce vita: Without a doubt an Italian, and Roman, classic. Federico Fellini's masterwork paints a picture of the social life of the time, and invites you to dive into the Trevi fountain , just like its protagonists! To Rome With Love: This 2012 film from the acclaimed Woody Allen, was filmed throughout the eternal city, and through its adventures takes in the Altare della Patria and the Baths of Caracalla . Gladiator: The winner of five Oscars , including best film and best actor for its protagonist, Russell Crowe\u2014this modern great, directed by Ridley Scott , includes stunning recreations of some of Rome's monuments and attractions including the Colosseum in its heyday.

        "text":"Baths of Caracalla - Opening hours, tickets and location - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Baths of Caracalla Situated near the Appian Way, the Baths of Caracalla are one of the largest and most impressive thermae built in antiquity in Rome. Book your tour Built between the years 212 and 216 under the direction of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, more commonly known as Emperor Caracalla, the Baths of Caracalla were one of the greatest and most spectacular thermal complexes in ancient times. In spite of the fact that today only the brick walls and large collapsed vaults remain, the remnant of the splendour of the Baths of Caracalla is still preserved. The splendour of the baths Going to the baths was a favourite pastime of the Romans, who visited them regularly both to maintain their hygiene and to improve their social relations. In the vast precinct that held the baths, the citizens could not only use the public baths but also dedicate their time to doing exercise, visiting the library, walking through the gardens or worshipping\u00a0the god Mithras and other pagan divinities by visiting the temple. The baths make up an architectural wonder when you keep in mind the date of their construction since they include effective water supply systems, as well as heating and drainage systems. The wood-fired ovens that were fed by the slaves served to heat the floors and walls of the baths, in addition to the water. Covered with marble and decorated with valued works of art, the Baths of Caracalla were the most sumptuous baths to be built in ancient times. Although subsequently they were surpassed in size by the Baths of Diocletian , these were not capable of matching their splendour. After remaining in operation for more than three hundred years, the baths were closed by necessity in the year 537, when the aqueducts that supplied water to the city were destroyed by the barbarians. The sculptures and valuable materials that decorated the baths were plundered and subsequently, in the year 847, an earthquake shook the building and destroyed part of it. The baths today In spite of the passing of centuries and of the lootings that the baths suffered, the ground floor of the buildings and a large part of the impressive walls that formed the precinct remain. By using your imagination it is possible to submerge yourself in the splendour of ages past.

        "text":"What to See in Rome in 3 Days - What to see in Rome in 3 days Civitatis Rome What to See in Rome in 3 Days Although the city is ideally seen in 4 or more days, sometimes visitors have only a weekend to see Rome . To make the most of your visit, check out our top tips for what to see\u00a0in Rome in 3 days, including stops at the Vatican City! Arrival: Squares and Fountains By the time you\u2019ve landed, found your hotel, and dropped your luggage off, there will probably not be enough time to visit any monuments. What should you do? The best plan is to take a walk through the city center and get to know its streets, squares (piazzas), and fountains. If you want to arrive at your hotel without any complications and as quickly as possible, we recommend checking out our transfer service from the airport in Rome to your hotel . If you'd prefer to save on this journey to the hotel, you can also get a bus for a good price: Buy tickets for the shuttle bus from Ciampino Airport to Rome . If your accommodation is in the outskirts, the best way to get to Piazza di Spagna is to get the metro (line A). If you\u2019re staying in the city center, it might be a better idea to go on foot. Once in Piazza di Spagna, take the Via dei Condotti, one of the city\u2019s most important high streets, until you get to the Via del Corso. Here, turn left. Walk down the street and cross the Piazza Colonna (where the Column of Marcus Aurelius is located). Two streets further down, turn to the left and take the Via delle Muratte. Walk a few meters until you are hit by a breathtaking sight: the Trevi Fountain . This is a great place to stop and enjoy the beauty of such a monument. If you are superstitious, you might want to throw a coin into the fountain. Walking back down Via delle Muratte, cross Via del Corso, and continue along Via di Pietra. Five minutes later, you\u2019ll arrive at the Pantheon , the best-preserved monument from the Roman Empire. If you\u2019d like to enjoy the views, you can order a cappuccino in one of the many terraces of the piazza. Leave the Pantheon via Salita de Crescenzi Street and follow the signs until you get to Piazza Navona . This impressive square houses the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the Fontana del Moro, and the Fountain of Neptune, as well as the Obelisk of Domitian. Exit the square from the south side (by the Fontana del Moro) and you\u2019ll arrive at Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a wider street. If you head down this street, on the left side, you\u2019ll come across the Area Sacra dell\u2019Argentina , an excavation where you\u2019ll be able to see the remains of Roman architecture from the Roman Republic. This area is especially beautiful when lit up. Continuing in the same direction you'll see the Monument to Victor Emmanuel II , a huge building built in honor of the first king of Italy. If you have time to spare, you can go and see the Piazza del Campidoglio . Choose a restaurant nearby and if you\u2019re not too tired you can go and have a drink at Campo dei Fiori , one of Rome\u2019s liveliest squares. If you'd like to explore with a guide on your first day in Rome, we recommend booking this night tour of Rome . Day 2: The Vatican City If you\u2019re visiting Rome during the weekend, you should dedicate the first day, Saturday, to explore the Vatican City and\u00a0its museums , since on Sundays the Vatican Museums are closed (apart from the last Sunday of each month). If you're only in Rome for 2 or 3 days, you should probably expect to wake up early.\u00a0To make the most of your time in Rome, you should make it to the Vatican City no later than 9 am. The best way to get to the Citt\u00e0 Vaticano is to take the metro to Ottaviano. Upon leaving the station, take the street with the same name until you arrive at St. Peter's Square . After having taken in the splendid views of St Peter\u2019s Square, join the queue to enter St Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the holiest temples for Christendom. Inside the Basilica, it's definitely worth climbing to the top of the dome (446 ft - 136 m tall) to get a bird\u2019s eye view of Rome and the Vatican City. The ascent is a little exhausting (especially if you choose the stairs), but it's also part of its appeal. When you come down from the dome you'll have to leave St. Peter's Square and follow the signs to get to the Vatican Museums. If you are lucky there won't be a long queue and you'll be able to enter more or less directly. If you like museums you can stay for hours or days, but remember\u00a0at the end of the museum\u00a0is Michelangelo's masterpiece: The Sistine Chapel . If you want to visit the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel without the long queues, we recommend this Vatican City guided tour . If you also want to enjoy the impressive St Peter's Basilica, you can opt for this more complete option: Tour with access to the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums and St Peter's Basilica . On finishing your visit to the Vatican, take Via della Conciliazione from St. Peter's Square. On this street is located the Castel Sant'Angelo (Castle of the Holy Angel) and the bridge, Ponte Sant\u2019Angelo, a Roman bridge that is considered one of the most beautiful ones in Rome. The castle is now a museum, definitely worth exploring. We also recommend checking out this Castel Sant'Angelo tour (with Terrace Access included) . Cross the bridge and follow the signs to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon , which you can visit. If there are still some hours of daylight and you wish to relax a bit, head to Villa Borghese , one of Rome\u2019s most romantic public parks. Here you can lie on the grass or go for a stroll and discover its lake and numerous buildings. If you\u2019re traveling with children, they will love this green space. Borghese Gallery guided tour At night there is nothing better than to wander\u00a0through the city streets taking in Rome\u2019s lively atmosphere and extraordinary architecture. If you didn\u2019t have time to visit Campo dei Fiori the previous day, why not go today and have a relaxing drink? Day 3: Imperial Rome If you enjoy history you'll have left the best for the last day, since today we shall visit the Roman Forum , the Palatine Hill , and the Colosseum . As soon as you leave the station you'll have before you the great wonder of ancient Rome: the Colosseum . If you find a long queue at the Colosseum (more than 15 minutes) you can\u00a0visit the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill first. The entrance fee is shared and you can then return to the Colosseum without waiting in line. To enjoy this experience to the max without long queues, we recommend booking the most popular guided tour in Rome: Guided tour of the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill . After finishing these visits you can access Capitoline Hill from the north side of the forum. When you get to Piazza del Campidoglio don't miss the statue of Romulus and Remus , located just before entering the square and often missed due to its location. Take the \u201cCordonata\u201d stairs that lead\u00a0to Via del Teatro Marcello and stay on the left side of the street. In less than 10 minutes you'll get to Santa Mar\u00eda in Cosmedin, where the Mouth of Truth is found. Once you\u2019ve visited the church, cross the river Tiber and you\u2019ll find yourself in Trastevere , one of Rome\u2019s most charming neighborhoods. The atmosphere is very lively and the restaurants are good quality and have very affordable prices. You can finish by having an ice cream in Santa Maria in Trastevere Square. If your flight doesn\u2019t leave until late, we recommend going to the ruins of the Circus Maximus or the Baths of Caracalla . If you want to enjoy the city to the fullest but prefer not to do it on foot, the Rome tourist bus is the ideal option to visit the main places of interest in complete comfort. Staying in Rome for more than 3 days? If you\u2019ve already done our 3-day Rome itinerary and you've got more time, why not check out our list of the most important museums or\u00a0catacombs?

        "text":"Things to Do in Rome - Top Attractions in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to Do in Rome Explore Rome's most impressive squares, fountains, monuments and attractions. Rome is a breath-taking open-air museum and these are its top sights. Millennia of history, unbeatable cuisine, and much more, Rome is rightfully one of the most popular tourist destinations on the planet . With so many things to do and see in Rome, one of the most difficult parts of visiting the Eternal City can be crafting the perfect itinerary. Read on to discover our must-dos! 1. Visit the Colosseum An ever-enduring symbol of the grandeur of Ancient Rome, the Colosseum is perhaps one of the most recognizable landmarks on the planet, as well as one of the 7 Wonders of the World. This breathtaking amphitheater is right in the heart of the city, and once would have accommodated as many as 80,000 spectators. These giant crowds would watch on as the venue played host to everything from epic gladiator fights to public executions. With Civitatis, there are lots of different ways of visiting this bucket list landmark. You don\u2019t need a guide to visit the Colosseum. However, to get the full experience, and to gain a deeper insight into the landmark\u2019s history, we recommend taking this guided tour of the Colosseum , which includes a pass for the gladiator's entrance, meaning you'll get to walk where so many gladiators would have emerged into the arena, to the roar of up to 80,000 Romans cheering.

        "text":"National Roman Museum - Palazzo Massimo alle Terme Civitatis Rome Things to do Museums and Art Galleries National Roman Museum One of the top attractions in Rome is the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, one of the four parts of the Museo Nazionale Romano. The National Roman Museum is located in four different buildings; the Baths of Diocletian , the Palazzo Altemps , the Crypta Balbi and lastly, the Palazzo Massimo . This last palace features one of the best archaeological and classical art collections in the world. The Palazzo Massimo is also called Palazzo Massimo alle Terme due to its close proximity to the Baths pf Diocletian. The villa is a superb Neo-Renaissance-style palace, erected between 1883 and 1887. It was used as a Jesuit college until 1960 and in 1981 it was transformed into part of the National Roman Museum. Exhibitions The various exhibitions of the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme are divided into different themes and organized chronologically throughout the four floors of the museum. The basement houses a collection of jewels, grave ornaments and Roman coins from different periods. This might be considered to be\u00a0the least interesting floor of the museum. The ground and first-floor feature famous\u00a0Greek and Roman sculptures and statues, as well as impressive sarcophagi\u00a0and high reliefs. The second floor\u00a0showcases the best preserved Roman frescoes in the world, which are considered the highlight of the museum. Originally located in the Villa of Livia and Villa Farnesina , these colourful frescoes, sometimes covering an entire room, represent different paradisiacal landscapes and domestic life. On the same floor, visitors will also see an impressive collection of mosaics from the second and fourth century AD. Well worth visiting After visiting the Borghese Gallery and Capitoline Museums , we recommend going to Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.

Book this guided tour Roman circuses were the most important centres of entertainment in the Roman cities, apart from the theatres and amphitheatres. They were extended precincts in which the public games were held , consisting of chariot races and different spectacles. The Circus Maximus in Rome (Circo Massimo), located between the Aventino and Palatine Hills, was an extended precinct with space for 300,000 spectators . The arena, which measured 600 meters in length and 225 meters in width, made the Circus Maximus the largest in Rome, ahead of the Circus of Flaminius and the Circus of Maxentius. Celebrations in the Circus Maximus In the Circus Maximus several competitions were carried out, standing out among them chariot races , in which participants tried to complete seven laps of the Circus Maximus. The competitors , mounted in small chariots drawn by horses, gambled much more than their prestige or large prizes in the races, since many of them were slaves fighting for their liberty . During the public games, equestrian exhibitions , known as \"Ludus Troiae\", also took place. These were a simulation of various famous battles carried out by young Roman aristocrats. There were also foot races that lasted for several hours. The spectators would bet on the winners, making the competitions even more exciting. The importance of using your imagination Currently, the ruins of what was once the Circus Maximus barely remain. There is only the enormous terrace that keeps the form that it had in its day, which often causes disappointment for tourists who visit it hoping to find at least the ruins of the precinct.

R - It is possible to book a private transfer service in Rome with a minimum of 8 hours in advance P - How long does the journey from the hotel to the airport take? R - If you book round-trip transfers, we recommend requesting pickup from your hotel 2.5 hours before your flight . The drive to Ciampino takes about 30 minutes, and around 40 minutes to Fiumicino. Good to know Please take care during the transfer and help keep the vehicle clean. Otherwise, the provider may apply an additional cleaning fee. P - What pick up time should I choose? R - For transfers beginning at the airport, you should indicate the time at which your flight is due to arrive. The same goes for cruise ports and train stations: you should indicate the planned arrival time. For transfers from your hotel, you should indicate when you would like to be picked up. That doesn't mean the flight time, rather the time you would like to be collected. For shared transfers, orders may be modified by the provider. Should this be the case, we will contact you to confirm the rearranged time. P - How long will the driver wait for me? R - Airports: 1 hour from the plane's arrival\u00a0time. Cruise ports:\u00a030 minutes from the time indicated when making your reservation. Tran stations: 15 minutes from the train's arrival time. Hotels and apartments: 15 minutes from the time indicated when making your reservation. If for any reason you need more time, please ring the telephone number on your reservation. Should this be the case, supplements may apply. P - Where will the driver be waiting for me? R - Airports: Meet&Greet transfer included : the driver will wait at the nearest available pickup point to the exit of the baggage claim area. Meet&Greet transfer not included : we'll email you the directions to the meeting point and\/or the driver will indicate it before the service. Ports : the driver will wait in the arrivals terminal. Train stations : the driver will wait at the exit of the train's arrival platform. Hotels and apartments :\u00a0the driver will wait outside the building. If it's possible to park, the driver may wait at reception. P - Are the prices final? Are there any extra charges? R - Unlike our competitors, our prices are final, and include all fees, including tolls and tips. Some extra charges may apply if the destination is not as arranged, or if an extra stop must be taken on the way. P - How many people can travel in the vehicle? R - The number of seats indicated for each vehicle is the maximum number of people who can travel, excluding the driver. All passengers, including small children no matter the age, count. If your group is large, you should reserve more than one vehicle. P - How many suitcases can I take? R - During the reservations process you can see the amount of luggage that each vehicle allows. Each vehicle comes with indications as to its maximum capacity for large suitcases and hand luggage. The maximum dimensions per type of suitcase are: Hand luggage: total length, height and width\u00a0adding up to no more than 115 cm. Large suitcase:\u00a0total length, height and width adding up to no more than 155 cm. P - Are child seats available? R - During the reservation process you'll see information regarding child seats. Depending on the regulations in each destination, these may be obligatory or optional, and they may be free or imply an additional cost. You will see this cost added before booking. P - How can I find out my flight number? R - The flight number is comprised of 2 characters that represent the airline, and 4 numbers for the flight number. Some examples are IB3506, UX1254, or 5Z1826. You can find your flight number on the airline's confirmation email. P - Do I have to let someone know if my flight, boat, or train is delayed? R - Flights, trains and boats are constantly monitored, so you don't have to worry about getting in touch with us. Should the delay be large, if it's impossible to reprogram the transfer as there are no vehicles available, we'll refund the full amount paid. P - Why do I need a working mobile phone? R - A working mobile phone is needed so we can call you should there be any emergency, such as a breakdown, or simply if the driver can't find you. P - Who is responsible for a missed flight? R - The transfer company is never responsible for a missed flight. The clients are those who must know what time the flight leaves, and book pick up far enough ahead of time. P - Is it possible to make various stops? R - If you're staying in different hotels, or you need to make a stop to pick up keys, this service comes with supplemental charges. Once you have made your reservation, we'll send you an email with the amount. You can accept or cancel the service at no cost. You can pay online or in-destination. P - Can I share the vehicle with other people? R - We offer both private and shared transfers. In the case of private services, the vehicle will be for you alone. For shared transfers, you will share the vehicle with other passengers. P - Will the driver speak English? R - Although in the majority of countries, the drivers will speak several languages, we can't guarantee that the driver assigned to you will speak English. Nonetheless, it shouldn't be necessary to complete the transfer, as the driver will have all the necessary details. P - Do you have transfers in other destinations? R - Yes, here you can see all the destinations where we offer airport transfers .

Our flight was delayed by over an hour, I sent a message to the provider (just to be sure, because they had the flight number too) and they replied saying everything was fine, and when we arrived, the transfer was waiting for us!

Repasamos todos los dem\u00e1s meeting point que hab\u00eda y mi nombre no estaba. Estuvimos una media hora busc\u00e1ndolo, de un sitio a otro. Al final lo encontramos en otro meeting point, en el que anteriormente ya hab\u00edamos mirado. Con todo el agobio de gente, fue una experiencia desagradable. Pero luego el conductor fue muy amable y estuvo haci\u00e9ndonos un peque\u00f1o tour por la ciudad. I travelled with my partner Al ser un traslado compartido el conductor estaba en otra terminal a la espera de pasajeros que llegaban en un vuelo anterior.

However, our flight landed at 8:30 and we didn\u2019t get in the car until 9:15. The only reason I didn\u2019t just hop in a taxi is because I already booked the transfer. Called the company and was able to speak to someone that told me the driver was on the way which was helpful. Would be nice if they had arrived on time seeing that they tell you you\u2019ll be charged an extra fee if you\u2019re an hour late. I travelled with friends This was a shared transfer, so the trip does not start until the driver picks up every passenger. \ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce 10 \ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce 05 \/ 12 \/ 2019 J Jo\u00e3o Luiz Amazonas Pimp\u00e3o Curitiba, Brazil Apesar do atraso no v\u00f4o e da demora para os tr\u00e2mites de entrada no pa\u00eds, espera da bagagem e chegar ao ponto de encontro, o motorista da Civitatis estava nos aguardando pacientemente mesmo ap\u00f3s decorrido um hor\u00e1rio maior do que normalmente a empresa se comprometeu a nos esperar.

The gallery features an important part of the collection begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (nephew of Pope Paul V), between 1576 and 1633. As well as an avid art collector of Caravaggio\u2019s works, the Cardinal was Bernini\u2019s first sponsor. Thus, the museum has an extensive collection of both artists. Exhibitions The exhibitions are found on the mansion\u2019s bottom and top floor. The first floor houses works of art by renowned artists such as Tiziano, Raphael, Caravaggio, Rubens and Botticelli. The ground floor is dedicated to classic antiquities from the first to the third centuries AD.

        "text":"Rome Metro - Lines, hours, fares and Rome metro maps Civitatis Rome Public Transport Rome Metro The Metro of Rome only has three lines and is currently the smallest metro system in Europe. Nevertheless, it reaches the city's most important landmarks. Opened in 1955, the metro (subway or underground) in Rome has grown slowly over time,\u00a0and currently only operates 37,3 miles (60 km) made up of three lines . It is one of the smallest metros in Europe. Currently, there are plans to expand the subway system . The reason why it's\u00a0so limited\u00a0is that each time a new tunnel is built, more archaeological remains are found;\u00a0something which also happens in Athens . Most important\u00a0metro stations Although the metro only comprises three lines, it gets to most of the city\u2019s top attractions. These are the most important stops to keep in mind: Line A (Orange) The most used by both locals and tourists. It runs through Rome stopping at\u00a027 stations going from northwest to southeast.\u00a0Starting at Battistini and going to Anagnina, the line runs with a frequency of 3 minutes to 5 minutes depending on the day of the week. The most important stops starting from the west are: Cipro - Musei Vaticani : The closest stop to the Vatican Museums and to the Sistine Chapel. Ottaviano - San Pietro : This station is a few minutes\u2019 walk from St. Peter's Square and St. Peter's Basilica. Spagna : Very convenient for visiting Piazza di Spagna and Villa Borghese. Barberini - Fontana di Trevi : This station is five minutes away from Trevi Fountain It is also the closest station to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Termini: Stops at Roma Termini railway station. Here, visitors can take the Leonardo Express to get to Fiumicino Airport. Line B (Blue) Running from northeast to south, line B goes from Laurentina to Rebibbia or Jonio, as it's also divided into two. It has 22 stations plus an extension of four more. Frequency is 5 minutes on weekdays and about 9 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. The most important stops starting from the north are: Termini : Transfer point between two lines and arrival point of the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino. Colosseo : Located near the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Piramide : If you come in the FR1 regional train from Fiumicino, you will be able to take the metro from this stop. Line B1 was inaugurated in 2012 and trains split upon arrival at Bologna station, where one branch continues to Rebibbia and another to Jonio. L\u00edne\u00a0C (Verde) Inaugurated in 2014 , this line runs through Rome from the center to the east , connecting San Giovanni (line A) to Monte Compatri-Pantano. It's less significant for tourists since, until its completion, it mainly serves the eastern area with few points of interest. Trains run every 12 minutes, every day of the week Where to get a ticket? Tickets can be purchased at the subway stations, at newsstands, and in most corner shops.

Area Sacra 1 See photo gallery The discovery The Area Sacra was discovered between 1926 and 1930 during construction work on a building. The area was occupied by four temples built in the third century B.C. , and by the Theatre and Curia of Pompey, the place in which Julius Caesar was murdered. As it's not known to whom the temples were dedicated, they were renamed with the letters A, B, C, and D. The city of cats Since the first excavations in the Area of Sacra in Rome were carried out, hundreds of cats have decided to make the area their home . Nowadays, it's very common to see them walking calmly, feeling protected among the ruins. Next to the iron gates that protect the zone, signs can be seen indicating that the cats are welcome and that they should not be mistreated.

This bath\u00a0complex was the largest of ancient Rome. Baths of Diocletian Exhibition in the Baths of Diocletian Cloister of the Baths of Diocletian 3 See photo gallery History The construction of the Roman baths began in 298 and was completed in 306. The structure of the baths was very similar to that of the Baths of Caracalla. They were made of bricks, coated in marble and decorated with mosaics and sculptures . The whole complex took up 120,000 square meters and included a gymnasium, a library, and cold, hot and tepid public baths . During the construction, thousands of Christian slaves died. Diocletian, ill and tired, abdicated in 305. The Roman public baths remained open until 537, when the Goths cut off the aqueducts in an attempt to conquer Rome. In 1561, Pope Pius IV ordered Michelangelo to build the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli on the remains of the baths to honour all the Christian slaves who died. National Museum of Rome Open to the public after thirty years of reconstruction, the 10th Hall of the Baths of Diocletian were made part of the National Museum of Rome in 2008. Nowadays, only a small part can be visited , in which it is possible to see the high ceilings the baths had. The interior of the remains includes an impressive funerary sculpture and two tombs decorated with frescoes and stucco, which are believed to date from the beginning of the second century AD. In the outdoor part of the baths\u00a0it is possible to stroll through a sixteenth century garden with nearly 400 works of art , including statues, sarcophagi and reliefs. Impressive Even though the ruins show only a small part of the public baths complex, it is extremely impressive . Visitors can also explore the tombs,\u00a0which are very well preserved.

It was built to commemorate\u00a0Emperor Ferdinand II's victory\u00a0at the Battle of White Mountain. The basilica has become extremely popular since it appeared in the novel Angels & Demons , written by the American author Dan Brown. In its interior Although the church's fa\u00e7ade isn\u2019t very impressive, its interior is extravagantly decorated. Since there is very little natural light inside the church, it is filled with candles, which create a very special atmosphere . One of the most notable parts of the church is the Cornaro Chapel , which houses the \u201c Ecstasy of Saint Teresa \u201d, a sculpture by Bernini. This figure is considered to be a sculptural masterpiece of the Baroque period. The interior of Santa Maria della Vittoria suffered a fire in 1833 and had to be restored. However, nowadays, it's completely reconstructed. The Fountain of Moses Near the Basilica Santa Maria della Vittoria stands the grandiose Fontana dell\u2019Acqua Felice, in English the Fountain of Moses. It was designed to symbolise the end of the Acqua Felice aqueduct. Although this fountain is not very popular among the Romans on account of its disproportion and its sheer size, it's an imposing architectural ensemble worth taking a look at . Impossible to Visit all the Churches in Rome Because of the vast number of churches in Rome, it's impossible to visit them all.

The Pantheon of Agrippa , also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome . The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 B.C and\u00a0that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D. At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who transformed it into a church , in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state of preservation. Architecture The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres . The dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica . At its top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building. The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: \"M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT\" , which means \"Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built this temple when he was a Consul.\" The interior In the interior of the Pantheon the tombs of numerous Italian kings and a multitude of art works are found. The best-known person who can be found buried in the Pantheon is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael .

        "text":"Rome as Capital of Italy - Recent history of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870 . Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world. The unification process of Italy started in 1848 and ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Since Rome was under the control of the Papacy, Florence was made the temporary capital of Italy. In 1870, Italian troops entered Rome, ending more than one thousand years of Papal control over the city. However, the Pope did not accept the unification of the peninsula and took refuge in the Vatican until February 11th, 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed by Mussolini and Pope Pius XI, creating the Vatican state . Mussolini and the National Fascist Party, allies of Nazi Germany, marched into Rome in 1922 and came to power in the country, declaring a new Italian Empire. During the following years many monuments , buildings and streets were restored and Rome became the administrative capital, increasing the population of Rome, from 212,000 inhabitants to over one million (during the Roman Empire, Rome had over 2 million inhabitants). During World War II, Rome\u00a0was hardly bombed compared to other cities. This was largely due to\u00a0the Americans not wanting to destroy Rome because in its centre was the neutral\u00a0Vatican City and Pope Pius XII, who remained in the city throughout the war. Finally, on June 4th, 1944, Rome was taken by the Allies. In 1946, the monarchy was overthrown and a republic was put in place. During the 50s and 60s, a period known as the Dolce Vita (meaning the sweet life), Rome became a very fashionable city . Next, in the 1980s, the population grew reaching 2,800,000 .\u200b On March 25th 1957, the \u201cTreaty of Rome\u201d was signed in this city by 6 countries. It established the European Economic Community (EEC) and The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). The \u201cTreaty of Rome\u201d would later give birth to the creation of the European\u00a0Union. Rome in the 21st Century Currently, Rome\u2019s historic centre still reflects its colourful past. Visitors will find traces of ancient Rome , Renaissance palaces, fountains, piazzas , Baroque churches and other architectural styles\u00a0dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. As the capital of Italy, Rome has most of the country's political buildings. The population has grown exponentially and now is at about 2.8 million.

The Basilica is the oldest church in Europe. Founded during the fourth century in honour of St. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, St John Lateran (Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano) is the Cathedral of Rome and the most important of the four major basilicas. It is known as St John Lateran Archbasilica, as is it considered the mother church of the Roman Catholic faithful. History In the early part of the fourth century, the Laterani family were stripped of their land as one of their members was accused of conspiring against the Emperor. It was given to the Bishop of Rome in order to build the first Roman basilica. Throughout the centuries, St John Lateran has survived several fires and an earthquake in 897. Nevertheless, it still maintains its first form even though it has been reconstructed on several occasions. Near the Archbasilica there\u00a0was a monastery, which has completely disappeared now;\u00a0the only part still standing is its beautiful cloister from the thirteenth century. \u00a0The Basilica also houses a baptistery, which for many years was the only baptistery in Rome. The Basilica of St. John Lateran has played an important role throughout history; it was here that all popes were enthroned up until 1870. Nowadays, Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterno is where the Pope, as Bishop of Rome, celebrates Holy Thursday Mass. Interior The two-story portico on the Basilica\u2019s main fa\u00e7ade was constructed during the eighteenth century, and it is where the Pope blesses the congregation on Holy Thursday. On the top part of the fa\u00e7ade\u00a0visitors will see imposing statues of the Apostles and Jesus, also dating from the eighteenth century. The central doors made of bronze were previously used at the Roman Senate House (the Curia Julia) within the Roman Forum . The Basilica\u2019s interior is magnificent with colossal statues, mosaics and frescoes from the ceiling to the ground, with impressive columns. The Holy Stairs (Scala Santa) are located near the Lateran Basilica. These are renowned because it is believed that Jesus Christ stepped on them during His Passion. They were relocated from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by St Helena. One of the most beautiful basilicas of Rome The Cathedral of Rome is among the most beautiful churches in Rome and is a definite must-see. We also recommend visiting San Clemente and Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini .

        "text":"Villa d'Este (Tivoli) - Reviews and how to get there and back Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa d'Este (Tivoli) Villa d\u2019Este is a sumptuous Renaissance dwelling located in the outskirts of Rome. It stands out for its beautiful gardens and charmingly decorated rooms. A former Franciscan monastery expropriated by the governor of Tivoli, the Villa d\u2019Este was built during the sixteenth century in Tivoli as a stately Renaissance-style mansion with enchanting gardens. Nowadays, it is a museum listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. What to see All the rooms in Villa d\u2019Este are beautifully decorated with frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings. However, the most breathtaking part of the villa is the fantastic views of the garden and countryside below. Strolling through the mansion\u2019s lush gardens full of sculptures and over 500 fountains is the best part of the visit. The enclosure\u2019s Hundred Fountains (Cento Fontane in Italian), located between the Fontana di Rometta and the oval fountain, is an architectural masterpiece. The garden also houses a superb waterfall, and the Fountain of the Organ (Fontana dell\u2019Organo) is worthwhile discovering. In 1571, the fountain had a water organ installed in it, which was\u00a0astonishing to everyone who heard it. A perfect getaway If you want to spend a day discovering Tivoli, Villa d\u2019Este is a definite must. Exploring its gardens while enjoying the coolness of its fountains and the shade of its trees is extremely agreeable, especially in summer. Villa d\u2019Este is located just 19 miles (30 km) from Rome, making it a perfect getaway trip from the bustling city. Visitors can combine this visit with Villa Adriana , which is located very close by. Getting to Villa d\u2019Este There are several ways of getting to Villa d\u2019Este: Guided tour : This is the easiest option. It includes a hotel pick-up, transport there and back, guided tour in English and admissions tickets. The price per person is \u20ac 125\u00a0and can be booked here: Villa Adriana and Villa d'Este Excursion . Bus : The buses that travel from Rome to Tivoli leave from the bus station Ponte Mammolo ( metro line B) and the company name is Cotral. It costs \u20ac 2 to \u20ac 3per journey. Car rental : We recommend this option if you\u2019re planning on renting a car for a few days, otherwise it is quite expensive and isn\u2019t worthwhile. You can rent a car here . Although it is also possible to go by train, it takes 1 - 1.5 hours, costs \u20ac 3 and leaves you further away from Villa d\u2019Este than the bus. If you\u2019d also like to visit Villa Adriana , there is a bus connecting both mansions for \u20ac 1.

        "text":"Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli - Opening hours and location Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli The Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli (St. Peter in Chains) was built in the 5th century to house the chains with which St. Peter was imprisoned in Jerusalem. The church is also known for its famous sculpture of Michelangelo's Moses. Origins of the Basilica According to legend, Empress Eudoxia gave Pope Leo I the chains with which Saint Peter had been shackled in Jerusalem as a present, and to house these, he commissioned San Pietro in Vincoli Basilica to be built. When Pope Leo I held these chains near Peter\u2019s chains from the time he spent in Mamertime Prison in Rome Inside San Pietro in Vincoli The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is different from any other church built during the same period thanks to its simplicity and scarce decoration. Under the main altar is the reliquary in which the chains of Saint Peter, the church\u2019s most important element, are kept. Another impressive part of the church is the mausoleum of Pope Julius II, made up of Michelangelo\u2019s striking statue of Moses, designed between 1505 and 1515. The mausoleum is dimly lit until one of the visitors makes a donation and it lights up, something which is done throughout most of the churches in Rome. Among the small altars found on both sides of the church, we recommend taking a close look at those found on the left-hand side. Visitors will see frescoes depicting skeletons and other images which are not very commonly shown in Catholic churches. Well worth visiting The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is well worth visiting not only because of its unique decoration and Michelangelo\u2019s massive statue of Moses, but because\u00a0it is unlike any other Roman church.

Magnificent buildings surround three sides of the square. Obelisk and the Fontana di Castore e Polluce One of the most striking elements of the square is the obelisk , which is located next to the statues on which Castor and Pollux, patrons of horse riders , are taming several\u00a0horses. One of the most striking elements of the square is the obelisk with a fountain located at its feet. On either side of the monument, there are two statues of Castor and Pollux , each flanked by a horse. These twin brothers from Roman mythology were considered the patron gods of horses. Before being relocated to Piazza del Quirinale, the statues had decorated the entrance of the Baths of Constantine and the obelisk had stood on the Mausoleum of Augustus. Palazzo del Quirinale Designed as a summer residence for Pope Gregory XIII in 1573, the Palazzo del Quirinale became the royal family residence after the unification of Italy . After Italy had become a republic, the palace became the presidential home in 1947. Changing of the guard The changing of the guard ceremony takes place every day at 3 pm in front of the Palazzo Quirinale .

        "text":"Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was designed by Michelangelo and is the only Renaissance style church in Rome. The temple, located very near Piazza della Repubblica , is one of the most surprising and unique in the city thanks to its ruined fa\u00e7ade that contrasts\u00a0with its vast and sensational interior. Construction of the temple The site where Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was erected was where the Baths of Diocletian had been founded, an impressive demonstration of the glory of the Roman Empire until, in an intent to conquer Rome, the Goths cut the water supply of all the aqueducts of the city, and the baths had to be\u00a0abandoned. When neglected, the baths were taken over by bandits and courtesans until the Renaissance, when the grounds were bought by the French cardinal Jean du Bellay, who commissioned the construction of a beautiful villa and its gardens. A Sicilian priest suggested building a church on the site of the Baths of Diocletian, in honour of all the Christian slaves who died while building the baths. Several decades later, in 1560, the priest\u2019s efforts were rewarded by Pope Pius IV who commissioned Michelangelo to transform the baths into a church. Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli The interior of the church is remarkable and completely unpredictable from looking at its bare fa\u00e7ade. \u00a0With an impressive dimension, the temple is beautifully decorated with vast frescoes on its walls and enormous coloured marble columns. On the floor, visitors will be able to see the meridian solar line built by the astronomer and philosopher Francesco Bianchini in 1703. \u00a0Bianchini\u2019s meridian would tell when noon was throughout the year, the arrival of the solstices and equinox, as well as a calendar. Santa Maria degli Angeli houses an\u00a0impressive organ, recently bought, with 5,400 tubes. It is capable of leaving the church\u2019s visitors who are lucky enough to hear it spellbound. A very special temple There are countless churches of all sizes and from different periods in Rome, but, without a doubt, Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is one of the most remarkable and impressive churches in the city.

        "text":"Ostia Antica - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Ostia Antica Once the harbour city of ancient Rome, Ostia Antica is now a vast archeological site, located near the city of Rome. The town was abandoned and buried for over ten centuries until it was rediscovered. Book a guided tour Nowadays, Ostia Antica is a large archaeological site. Located just 19 miles (30 km) west of Rome and on the River Tiber.\u00a0During ancient Rome, it was one of the most thriving cities in the region thanks to its status as Rome\u2019s harbour city. After the collapse of the Empire, the city fell into decadence, was eventually abandoned and remained untouched and magnificently preserved for centuries. History Ostia Antica became Rome\u2019s main seaport during the Roman Republic (509 BC \u2013 27 BC) and the city was largely improved by Julius Caesar and Tiberius,\u00a0during part of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, the Romans slowly began to depend on other ports, meaning that the commercial activity in Ostia slowed down until it fell into decay during the fourth century AD. During the same period, the inhabitants of Ostia were hit by malaria and many fled to save their lives. This is how a city which had once a population of 100,000, was abandoned and turned into a forgotten port during several centuries. The city is relatively well preserved, but not as well as Pompeii or Herculaneum , where the cities were completely buried under volcanic ash and mud. What to see The archaeological site still houses the remains of most of the city\u2019s buildings before it was abandoned. Ostia\u2019s main arterial street, called Decumanus Maximus in Roman cities, cuts through the whole city, while the arcades on both sides of the street show the houses and shops which once thrived here. There are also taverns, inns, shops, public baths and a large reconstructed theatre, which is still used during the summer. The harbour city had a very cosmopolitan population, visible thanks to\u00a0a Jewish synagogue, a Christian Basilica and the\u00a018 temples dedicated to the Persian god Mithra. Less interesting than Pompeii If you aren\u2019t going to visit Pompeii or Herculaneum, then Ostia Antica is an archaeological site well worth visiting in which it is possible to imagine how the city\u2019s inhabitants lived centuries ago. However, compared to Pompeii or Herculaneum, it is less impressive and less well preserved. If you visit the site during the summer, we recommend taking water and a hat to protect you from the sun, since there is little shade in the site. Directions from Rome Unless you have a car or wish to book a guided tour, Ostia Antica is very close to Rome and is easy to get to by public transport. To get there using public transportation take the metro (line B) and get off at Piramide. Here, take the Roma Lido commuter train to Ostia Antica. Once at the station, all you have to do is follow the crowd. It is a 10-minute walk away. The train to Ostia costs \u20ac 1.50\u00a0(like any other one-way journey ). Since you are going to use quite a lot of public transport, you might want to buy a day pass.

Find out the main bus lines in Rome, their schedules and frequencies and tips to help you get around the city on this type of public transport. Since the metro lines of Rome are rather limited, visitors will most likely need the bus public transport system to get to certain parts of the city. It may not be the most comfortable or punctual form of transportation .\u00a0Nevertheless, to get to certain monuments and museums it is essential to use the bus . Currently, Rome has 338 bus lines that run throughout the day, 22 night buses and 8,260 stops . While the\u00a0size is impressive based on the numbers alone, delays and long waits are also worth mentioning as quite common occurrences. Presently, Rome has introduced a fleet of electric vehicles . Types of buses In Rome there are various types of lines, these are the most popular: Urban lines (U) : The large majority. They start between 5 am and 6:30 am and finish at midnight. It's important to note that the frequency varies. Night buses (N) : These lines operate while the urban lines \"rest\", that is to say, between midnight and 5:00-6:00 am. They operate with very little frequency but are very punctual. Express (X) : These lines are for the outskirts of Rome, for longer journeys. Exact (E) : These lines link the centre with the surrounding neighbourhoods. They run on fixed timetables. How to catch a bus? Are the bus lines in Rome the most complex in Europe? They might just be. Fortunately, each stop provides detailed information about the bus lines that serve it. This includes the route, operating days, and the schedule for the first and last buses. While this information seems straightforward, the reality on the ground can be different. When you've been waiting for half an hour without seeing a bus, you'll understand the challenge. Luckily, many bus stops are being upgraded with electronic displays showing the time until the next bus arrives. Buses also transmit their location to dispatchers, who notify passengers in three different ways In arrivo : the bus is arriving 3 Fer 2' : 3 stops away (fermate), arriving in 2 minutes A capolinea : the bus is at the first stop along its route Where to buy a bus ticket? Bus tickets can be bought in any metro station, newsstand or convenience store . If you are planning on using the bus regularly, we recommend you buy a few at a time or get a travel card , which might be a better option. Always validate your ticket Although at first you may think that everyone sneaks on the buses, the reason no one validates the ticket is because they have monthly passes. Remember that you can enter through any door, but don't forget to insert the ticket in the machines or you may be fined even if you have the ticket .

It is the first modern square to be designed in Rome . Book this guided tour The piazza came about because Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, organized a visit to Rome in 1536. Pope Paul III was so dismayed by the state of the sodden Capitoline Hill that he commissioned Michelangelo to design a square. The design of the square Michelangelo wanted the square to face St Peter\u2019s Basilica , the political centre of Rome, instead of the Roman Forum. \u00a0He also proposed the construction of another palace, Palazzo Nuovo , which would face Palazzo dei Conservatori . This palace, in its turn, would have a new fa\u00e7ade. The Palazzo Senatorio \u2019s front would also be redesigned so that all the buildings and the square would work harmoniously. An imposing bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was erected in the centre of the square. It is currently housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori and in the square stands a replica of the Roman Emperor instead. The execution of the plans took so long that Michelangelo didn\u2019t live to see his work completed. Nevertheless, his designs were followed meticulously and finished several centuries later. Twenty-first century Piazza del Campidoglio The Piazza del Campidoglio is one of the most beautiful squares in Rome , attracting millions of visitors every year. Its popularity is also due to its proximity to the Capitoline Museums and the legendary sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf , situated between the Palazzo Senatorio and Palazzo Nuovo.

        "text":"Basilica di San Clemente - Basilica in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di San Clemente The Basilica di San Clemente is a minor basilica dedicated to Pope Clement I. This temple is remarkable because archaeologically, it records the history of Rome from the beginning of Christianity up until the Middle Ages. History During the second century AD, the site on which the church now stands was occupied by a Roman mansion owned by Titus Flavius Clemens, one of the first Roman senators to convert to Christianity. The house was used for Christian clandestine worship since being Christian at the time was forbidden. Approximately a century later, a temple dedicated to Mithras, an all-seeing Protector of the Truth, was built on the same site. It would remain in use for the performance of rites of initiation until the late third century. On the second floor of the mansion, a large room was built, which would later become a basilica commissioned by Pope Siricius\u00a0after the end of Christian persecution in 313 AD. It is believed that the church was badly damaged during the Norman sack of Rome in 1084. It was thus abandoned and buried under the level of the streets of the city. Years later, a new church, commissioned by Pope Paschal II, was erected on the same site and finished in 1108. It is the same that still stands today. Interior At first sight, the Basilica of San Clemente looks like any other church in Rome. However, inside there are numerous and unimaginable treasures. The small temple is beautifully decorated with twelfth-century mosaics. The entrance to the fourth-century church is through the sacristy, in which, despite the cold, darkness and moisture, visitors will be able to see the numerous frescoes on the walls, as well as some fragments of mosaics that used to cover the temple floor. Not only is the old basilica open, but visitors can also see the ancient Roman villas made of old brick. In one of the rooms, water flows through the Cloaca Maxima, the main sewer system of ancient Rome. A walk through the past San Clemente is a unique attraction, definitely worth visiting. It not only offers a visit to a beautiful temple from the twelfth century, but visitors can also discover a fourth-century temple and an old Roman mansion, walking down dark and humid passageways.

        "text":"Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire was founded when Augustus Caesar proclaimed himself the first emperor of Rome in 31 BC and came to an end with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. An empire is a political system in which a group of people are ruled by a single individual, an emperor or empress . The Roman Empire began with the reign of Emperor Augustus. The power of the Senate was limited and became an organ to support the emperor. The period between Augustus and Diocletian is called the High Empire, while\u00a0the Low Empire is the era between Diocletian and the fall of the Roman Empire in the West. The High Empire (31 BC -\u00a0305 AD) The Roman Empire at its territorial peak Between the years 14 and 68\u00a0the heirs of Augustus succeeded him: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. This dynastic succession was interrupted when emperor Nero died and a civil war broke out in the year 68. Three emperors fought for power and finally, the war was won by Vespasian, part of the Flavian dynasty. The Flavian dynasty was succeeded by the Antonines (96 \u2013 193) , a generic name given to Nerva , Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus . These emperors had a very similar policy to the Flavians. The accession of Septimius Severus (197 -\u00a0235) made him the first of the Imperial Severan Dynasty to rule (197 - 235). He was replaced by\u00a0Caracalla, Macrinus, Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. The absolute power of Rome, the capital of the Empire, was weakened over time. Between 235 and 300\u00a0Rome\u2019s only priority was to defend its borders from the continuous attacks by the Barbarians and from the Sasanians (from Persia). The pressure of these raids prompted the army to assume power in 235. This era is known as the military anarchy and lasted about 50 years. The emperors of this time had one sole purpose:\u00a0fighting the Empire\u2019s enemies and securing the borders. As a consequence of these constant wars, the army was\u00a0very expensive to maintain, and thus\u00a0the Empire became crippled with debts. This in turn impoverished the population and many lost their identity and values. Many were put in doubt of their religious beliefs, especially with the arrival of new doctrines from the East. The persecution of an ever-growing Christian minority by Diocletian was a way to rid the empire of the dangers it was facing . In 284 a military revolt saved the Empire and Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. During his rule\u00a0he instaured the Tetrarchy, a form of government that divided the power. Diocletian designated the general Maximian to take charge of the western regions of the Empire, while the emperor governed over the eastern regions. Years later, he would appoint two Caesars. Diocletian abdicated in 305, revealing that the Tetrarchic political system didn\u2019t work without someone to lead it. The Low Empire (305 AD - 476 AD) After the abdication of Diocletian in 305, a series of conflicts took place until 312, when Constantine became the sole emperor of the West. He was to be the last emperor of the unified empire. He instituted Christianity as the official religion of the Empire. The capital of the Empire is moved to the ancient city of Byzantium , which is reconstructed. Byzantium, from November 8th, 324, was renamed Constantinople or the city of Constantine. Constantine\u2019s successor, Theodosius,\u00a0divided the empire between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius, creating the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476. Meanwhile, the other half,\u00a0called the Byzantine Empire , survived\u00a0until 1453 with the decline of Constantinople, now called Istanbul .

        "text":"Herculaneum - Opening hours, tickets & how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Herculaneum Located in the region of Campania, the town of Herculaneum suffered the same fate as Pompeii . The town was buried under Mount Vesuvius\u2019s volcanic ashes and mud in 79 AD. Hit before Pompeii, many inhabitants didn\u2019t have time to escape and were engulfed in layers of debris, ashes and mud, dying instantly to be preserved for centuries. What to see At the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the city was the volcano\u2019s first victim, and therefore\u00a0the first wall of lava, ashes, debris and gases covered Herculaneum completely a little after midnight on 25 August. The previous day, it had been plunged in a cloud of debris leaving it without sunlight. A UNESCO world heritage site , Herculaneum is better preserved than Pompeii . The city\u2019s houses, baths, taverns, temples and figures are undamaged; therefore, visitors will get a real sense of the splendour of this Roman city. Wealthier than its neighbouring Pompeii, the town is full of beautiful buildings. The different floors of most of the buildings are still intact and it is possible to see the magnificent frescoes and mosaics covering the walls of palaces, public buildings and mansions. On the far side of the city are the most luxurious villas overlooking the sea, notably the Villa dei Papiri, which was the luxurious retreat of Julius Caesar\u2019s father-in-law. In Herculaneum, archaeologists have also found the first Roman preserved skeletons from the first century, since prior to this period\u00a0Romans would cremate the dead. The skeletons are on display in one of the city\u2019s houses. Beautifully conserved The town of Herculaneum has been magically conserved all these years . Objects like beds, and doors managed to remain under the layers of ash and mud without decaying. Although it isn\u2019t as well-known or as large as Pompeii , Herculaneum\u2019s ruins are extremely impressive and gripping . Definitely worth visiting! Today, the town of Ercolano lies extremely close to the ruins of Herculaneum, creating an interesting contrast. Getting to Herculaneum The most common ways of getting to Herculaneum from Rome are: Train : Visitors need to take a train to Naples to get to Herculaneum. These leave from Termini railway station. Once in Naples, the Circumvesuviana line goes to Herculaneum (Ercolano Scavi station). It takes between 2 \u2013 3 hours to get there and the prices range from \u20ac 30 to \u20ac 100 for a roundtrip , depending on the train. Car rental : Although this is the cheapest option for families or groups of friends, you must keep in mind the price of petrol, parking and tolls. We would recommend this option only for those thinking of renting a car for additional days to visit other attractions nearby .

The most accepted date for the foundation of Rome is 753 BC . The first form of government in Rome was monarchical according to the archaeological findings and the legends. In the excavations carried out in the Roman Forum , in the Regia, which was the former royal residence, a glass of bucchero was found dating from the 7th century BC with the inscription Rex (king). The word regei was also found on the Lapis Niger, an ancient shrine in the Roman Forum. An inscription found beneath the black marble is considered to be a law. It's also possible to figure out when Rome was a kingdom thanks to other institutions in the Lazio region. For example, the rex Nemorensis (king of the forest), a priest of the goddess Diana who looked after the forests from the 6th century BC until the Roman Empire. Curiously, the Romans would maintain the same institutions throughout the centuries, transforming the roles of those in charge to suit the period. In this case, during the Roman Republic, the figure of the rex sacrorum (king of the sacred) substituted the king figure\u00a0but was only given religious functions. Romulus, son of the god of war and the daughter of the king Numitor, was the first king of Rome and also its founder, thus the city was called after him. He formed the Roman Senate with one hundred men and gave the inhabitants of Rome a body of laws. The Growth of Rome After founding the city, Romulus invited merchants and men of all kinds to settle in Palatine Hill. To increase the female population and give Rome\u2019s inhabitants wives, he abducted Sabine women. As a consequence, the Sabine King , Titus Tatius attacked Rome and took the Capitol . Finally , Romulus shared the kingship of the city with Titus Tatius until his death. The list of the 7 kings of Rome, or 8 if we include Titus Tatius, is as follows: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, Tarquinius Superbus . No historian doubts the existence of the last 3 kings, since there is clear evidence of their reigns in Rome. Nowadays, it's also believed that the first 3 kings of Rome also existed. Certain historians argue that the name of these 7 kings dates back to when the first Roman historians, in the 3rd century BC, wrote about the origins of Rome, which would confirm them to be true.

        "text":"Villa Adriana (Tivoli) - What to see in Tivoli from Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa Adriana (Tivoli) Nowadays, an important Roman archaeological site, Villa Adriana was commissioned by the Emperor Hadrian as a retreat from his palace in the capital. Book a day trip Located just outside of Tivoli, Villa Adriana is a collection of classical buildings created in the second century under the orders of Emperor Hadrian. It was a \u201csmall town\u201d consisting of palaces, fountains, and baths, as well as other structures that mimic various Greek and Egyptian architectural styles. The construction of Villa Adriana came about due to the fact that Adriano was unhappy in the palace on Palatine Hill, and he created it as his place of retreat. After his death, it was used by various successors, but eventually fell into disuse and ended up in ruins, which were looted. What to see in Villa Adriana With an area of 120 hectares\u00a0(296 acres), on which there are reconstructions of the emperor\u2019s favorite Greek and Egyptian buildings, Villa Adriana is a great architectural treasure that requires several hours for a visit. One of the most noteworthy parts of the villa, known as Canopus, is a copy of a sanctuary located near Alexandria. It's an enormous pool surrounded by columns and decorated with figures of the caryatids. Among the libraries, bathrooms, guest houses, gardens, fountains, and ponds, stands a structure known as the Maritime Theatre, a circular pool surrounded by columns with an island in the middle. On the island, there is a small Roman villa. The splendor of the past Although during the 16th century,\u00a0many of the statues and marble elements of Villa Adriana were looted to decorate the nearby Villa d'Este, you can still see how magnificent the villa was during its peak. If you have time to take a day trip to Tivoli from Rome, we believe it's definitely worth visiting both Villa Adriana and Villa d\u2019Este.\u00a0If you have time, take the opportunity to have lunch at Tivoli! Getting to Villa Adriana There are several ways to get to Tivoli\u00a0from Rome: Take a day trip : The easiest and most comfortable way to get to Tivoli from Rome is to take a day trip. This option includes hotel pickup, transport, an official English-speaking guide and entrance fees. The price of the excursion to Villa Adriana is \u20ac 125 per person and can be booked here: Hadrian's Villa and Villa d'Este Day Trip . Bus: The buses that make the journey from Rome to Tivoli are from the Cotral company, and they depart from the Ponte Mammolo station ( Metro line B). The fare is \u20ac 2 and the travel time is about 45 minutes. Rent a car: this option is a good one if you have it rented for more than just one day, if not, it's not worth it. You can rent a car in Rome by clicking here . Although it's possible to go by train from Rome to Villa Adriana, but we'd say it's not worthwhile. The trip is longer, about 1 hour depending on the train you take, although there are tickets from \u20ac 4. If you are visiting Villa d'Este, there is a bus that connects both villas for \u20ac 1.

History Originally, the Crypta housed a theatre, a block of four apartments and a patio . Built between 19 and 13 BC under Lucius Cornelius Balbus. The theatre had a crypt where people would go during the intermissions of the different plays. Over time, the theatre was forgotten and buried under other constructions.\u00a0Excavations on the site started in 1981 and twenty years later the remains were opened to the public and became part of the National Museum of Rome. Exhibitions The upper floor of the building features objects from the Antiquity and the Middle Ages, successfully depicting how the Romans lived between the fifth and tenth century. The ground floor presents what was found during the excavation. It is placed in such a way that visitors can get an idea of the history of the area.

        "text":"The History of Rome - From the Roman Empire up to the present day Civitatis Rome General Information The History of Rome How was Rome founded? How did it become an Empire? What was the role of the Catholic Church throughout Rome\u2019s history? Learn about the fascinating past of this striking city before you travel to Rome. The exact origins of the city of Rome are still somewhat of a mystery . There are several theories all based on the writings of ancient authors and the archaeological discoveries . For this reason, the founding of Rome is based mainly on legend and myth , instead of solid facts and figures. The existence of a Roman Kingdom was even questioned for\u00a0practically two centuries by expert historians. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they dismissed the idea of the early kings of Rome (Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius) as well as the date of the founding of what would later become the capital of Italy, in 753 BC. This part of history was merely considered a legend and not taken seriously. It was only during the late 20th century when, thanks to the findings of numerous archaeological\u00a0digs and other sciences,\u00a0the myths surrounding the establishment of the city and its first rulers were reconsidered . It's believed that the first inhabitants of Rome came from various parts of the region, and had neither the economic nor the cultural development of their northern neighbours, the Etruscans, nor\u00a0the southern civilization called the Sabines and Latins. In Palatine Hill ,\u00a0archaeologists\u00a0found the remains of a primitive settlement from the 8th century BC , with burials on the outskirts of the village. It's thought that as the population grew, the inhabitants settled on the slopes of the nearby hills, and during the next century\u00a0they established themselves in the valley. The history of Rome in stages Romulus and Remus Legend or not, Romulus and Remus, twins who grew up raised by a she-wolf, have gone down in history as the founders of Rome. The Monarchy (753 BC - 509 BC) When the city of Rome was founded in 754 BC, it had a monarchical form of government. Find out how the Monarchy was overthrown and what came next. Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Romans created a republican government after the overthrow of the Monarchy. During this period the legal system of ancient Rome was established. Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire is one of the greatest civilisations of all time, starting with the Republic's fall in 27 BC and ending with the last Emperor in 476 AD. The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and moving the capital to Constantinople, the Pope became more powerful in Rome over the following years. Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870. Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world.

        "text":"Catacombs of Rome - Underground burial places Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Catacombs of Rome The Catacombs of Rome are former underground burial grounds that date from the second to the fifth century and were principally used by Christians and Jews. Book a Tour The catacombs are subterranean passageways that were used as place of burial for a number of centuries . The burials of Jewish, pagan and early Christian Roman citizens in the catacombs began in the second century and ended in the fifth century. The word catacomb, which means \"next to the quarry\", comes from the fact that the first excavations to be used as a place of burial were carried out in the outskirts of Rome, next to the site of a quarry . The reason for the catacombs The Christians did not agree with the pagan custom of burning the bodies of their dead, for which reason\u00a0to solve problems created from a lack of space and the high price of land they decided to create these vast underground cemeteries. The catacombs possess a huge number of subterranean passageways that form real labyrinths that are several kilometres long , along which rows of rectangular niches were dug out . The corpses were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which were then covered with gravestones made of marble or, more commonly, baked clay. Subsequently, the name of the deceased was carved on the cover\u00a0accompanied by a Christian symbol . Roman law at the time prohibited the burial of the deceased in the interior of the city, for which reason all of the catacombs were located outside of the walls. These separated and hidden places below ground constituted the perfect refuge in which the Christians could bury their own, freely using Christian symbols . The end of persecutions On signing the Edict of Milan in the year 313, the persecution of Christians ceased , and they could begin to build churches and acquire land without fear of confiscation. In spite of this they continued to use the catacombs as cemeteries until the 5th century . During the barbarian invasion of Italy in the 8th century\u00a0many catacombs suffered continuous lootings, for which reason the Popes caused the still remaining relics to be transferred to the city's churches . After these transfers, some catacombs were abandoned completely and forgotten for centuries . Catacombs of Rome In Rome there are more than sixty catacombs made up of hundreds of kilometres of underground passageways that hold thousands of tombs. Currently only five of them are open to the public : Catacombs of San Sebastiano (Via Appia Antica, 136): These 12 kilometre long catacombs owe their name to San Sebastiano, a soldier who became a martyr for converting to Christianity. Together with those of San Callisto they are the best that can be visited. Opening times are Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antica, 126): With a network of passageways over 20 kilometres in length, the tombs of San Callisto were the burial place of 16 pontiffs and scores of Christian martyrs. Opening times are Thursday to Tuesday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Priscilla (Via Salaria, 430): These hold some frescoes that have great importance for art history, such as the first representations of the Virgin Mary. Opening times are Tuesday to Sunday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Domitilla (Via delle Sette Chiese, 280): Discovered in 1593, these catacombs, which\u00a0are more than 15 kilometres in length, owe their name to the granddaughter of Vespasian. Opening times are Wednesday to Monday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Sant\u2019Agnese (Via Nomentana, 349): After being a martyr because of her Christian faith, Sant\u2019Agnese was buried in the catacombs that subsequently bore her name. Opening times are from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00; the catacombs are closed on Sunday mornings and Monday afternoons. How to get to the Catacombs To visit the catacombs, you have several options: Take a tour : reserving\u00a0a visit is the easiest way of visiting the catacombs and monuments on the Via Appia. Here you can reserve a tour which includes transport, tickets, and an official guide. Public bus : although it's the cheapest way to get there, you can lose plenty of time heading there on your own. The 118 and 218 lines head to\u00a0San Calixto and\u00a0San Sebasti\u00e1n, and lines 218 and 716 go to Domitila. Taxi : the high price, and difficulty in finding a taxi for the return journey to Rome means we don't recommend this option. A walk through the insides of Rome The catacombs of Rome offer a very special visit in which the funeral remains of those buried many centuries ago can be seen. It is fascinating to travel through the dark and damp passageways, where you can see, in addition to the niches, some inscriptions with the names of the people that once occupied them. Due to the high infant mortality at that time, you can see a large quantity of spaces prepared for these children, alongside some larger graves in which the whole family was buried . During the visit, a guide who is specialized in the topic gives the visitors several\u00a0interesting facts relating to the catacombs and the period in which they were operating . The guided tours are in Spanish and are included in the cost of entrance.

        "text":"The Papacy in Rome - Rome after the fall of the Empire Civitatis Rome General Information History The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and the transfer of the imperial capital to Constantinople, the Pope gained power and became the sole authority in Rome. Since the capital of the Eastern Empire was moved to Constantinople and what was left of the Western Empire was taken to Ravenna, Rome lost its power and the only authority left was that of the Pope , who consolidated his power with the help of the Lombards and Charlemagne. Until 751, when it was invaded by the Lombards, Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. In 756, Pepin the Short granted the Pope power over regions near Rome, giving rise to the Papal States. The development of ancient Christianity made the Bishop of Rome both religiously and politically important and established Rome as the centre of Christianity. Until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, Rome was the capital of the Papal States . Until the 19th century, the papacy was in a constant struggle with the Holy Roman Empire and other powers in Europe . Nonetheless, Rome became a very powerful and wealthy city, with great international importance. Factors that contributed to Rome becoming such an important place during the Papacy include: first, it became the most important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages , secondly, in 1300 Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the first Holy Year (Jubilee), a year of great importance for Christians; thirdly,\u00a0the councils; fourth,\u00a0the Papal patronage became the focus of rebirth replacing Florence and finally the cultural influence of the city itself. The papal authority continued to be extremely strong until the 19th century. The End of Papal Authority The French Revolution put an end to the papal power. With the 1848 revolution, Rome became part of the unified Italy. After the battle of Porta Pia in 1870 (a battle led by Pius IX to maintain\u00a0his sovereignty over the Papal States) Rome was declared the new capital of Italy .

It provides some breath-taking views of Rome. The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele was inaugurated in 1911 as a tribute to Victor Emmanuel II , the first king of Italy after the country's\u00a0unification. Inside the building is the Institute for the History of the Italian Risorgimento and the Central Museum of the Risorgimento. Since 1921, the Victor Emmanuel Monument holds the tomb of the unknown soldier , a place in which the eternal flame shines and which is always guarded by two soldiers. A spectacular monument The colossal monument, which is 135 meters wide and 70 meters high , is comprised of scores of majestic Corinthian columns and endless stairs , all carved in white marble . The top is crowned with an equestrian sculpture of Victor Emmanuel cast in bronze and two chariots driven by the goddess Victoria. The monument was strongly criticised at its construction, since it was necessary to knock down numerous valuable buildings to make sufficient space, and Italian citizens did not agree with the idea of having such an eye-catching and elaborate building next to the other classical buildings that surround it . Panoramic terrace One of the greatest attractions of the Monument to Victor Emmanuel is the panoramic view that can be seen from the terrace located at the same height as the chariots . The panoramic elevators are the only way to reach the upper part of the monument, but the amazing views make it worth the effort to climb . The Museum of the Risorgimento The base of the monument holds the Museum of the Risorgimento;\u00a0a museum dedicated to the unification of Italy in which weapons, flags and other objects related to this historic moment are exhibited. Though\u00a0it may be an essential visit for Italian citizens, is not too interesting for foreign visitors. Cannot be ignored The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the most eye-catching buildings of the whole city .

Located in a building east of the Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish Steps , the museum contains many reminders of the lives of both poets and other writers of the time. History In November 1820, the English poet John Keats moved to Rome believing that the warm Italian climate would improve the health problems he suffered due to tuberculosis. Within less than a year he died in the same house where he lived, and in accordance with the laws of the time, his belongings were burned to prevent the spread of the disease. In 1906 the house was purchased by an American poet who restored it and turned it into the memorial it is today. During World War II, the house had to be hidden to prevent its destruction and the objects that were kept were sent to an abbey, where they remained hidden until 1944. Exhibitions The Keats-Shelley House has a large collection of manuscripts, first editions, sculptures and paintings depicting the lives of the poets to which it pays homage. The house also has one of the finest libraries of Romantic literature in the world, to which thousands of volumes are added every year. Not a must-see Unless you're a big lover of literature, Keat-Shelley House isn't one of the must-sees in Rome. We only recommend it to those who have an extended time in the city.

In Italy\u2019s capital, you\u2019ll find a wide variety of small shops selling traditional products, high streets, department stores and top international designer boutiques. Traditional products One of the most popular traditional products to buy in Italy is pasta. Visitors will find all types of pasta of different shapes and sizes, flavour and ingredients throughout the city. The best places to buy Italian pasta are in supermarkets or specialized shops. The most extravagant variations can cost up to \u20ac 4\u00a0for a 500-gram bag. Other products that make great presents are limoncello, olive oil or vinegar. If you like parmesan cheese, you can get some in Rome, which is normally a lot cheaper and better quality than in the rest of Europe or the US. If you want to spend as little as possible on these souvenirs, then the best place to get them is in a supermarket, although these are sometimes hard to find in the city. Fashion The Italian love of fashion is well known and the fact is that, although it is not Milan, Rome has some of the best designer boutiques in Italy. If you\u2019d like to discover these shops, head to Via del Corso, where the most prestigious boutiques are located, or to the streets surrounding Piazza di Spagna , especially Via dei Condotti, where you\u2019ll find Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari or Armani. Then walk to Via Veneto, where there are other stores of the same standard. If you\u2019re looking for counterfeit products, especially bags, you\u2019ll be surprised at how many people sell\u00a0these on the popular streets of Rome. It is possible to purchase a Gucci replica bag for \u20ac 20. Art and antiques Via del Babuino, connecting Piazzi di Spagna\u00a0to Piazza del Popolo , is famous for its antique and art shops. Via Margutta, which runs parallel to Via del Babuino, is also worth visiting. Souvenirs and gifts Souvenir shops and street stalls are found in Rome\u2019s most important tourist spots. If you are good at bargaining, you will be able to get the typical figurines and other souvenirs for great prices. Department stores Unlike most capital cities in Europe, Rome does not have many department stores. The closest to the city centre is the Galleria Alberto Sordi, on Via del Corso, near the Piazza Colonna. It opens every day from 10 am to 10 pm. Street markets Rome has several very interesting street markets full of traditional products, art, clothes and antiques: Porta Portese Market : Only open on Sunday mornings, this traditional flea market that sells from books to clothes to CDs is Rome\u2019s largest street market. It is spread throughout the streets of Trastevere Railway Station. Mercato dei Fiori : This market is open every morning and mainly sells flowers, vegetables and fruit. It is located in the Campo dei Fiori and is very charming. Piazza Fontanella Borghese Market : It opens every morning except Sundays and specializes in books and antiques. Visitors will find it near the Piazza di Spagna. Via Sannio Market : Five minutes from San Giovanni metro station is located Via Sannio Market. It\u00a0opens on weekdays until 8 pm (approximately).

See Trajan's Column up-close Trajan's Column is almost 40 metres high. Its\u00a0spiral bas-reliefs narrate in detail the unforgettable chapter of history in which the Roman Empire defeated the Dacians as if it were an open book. Originally, the more than 2,500 figures on Trajan's Column were decorated with bright colours, making it look even more magnificent. More than 50 of the figures depicted Trajan , the architect of the Roman people's victory over the Dacians. The depictions were particularly useful for those who could not read, vividly conveying the triumphant episode of the battle, allowing the populace to witness the might of Rome under the leadership of Trajan . At the time of its construction, the column was located inside Trajan's Market , but over the centuries, the imposing market fell into disrepair and a large part of the installations were lost, leaving the majestic column outside the complex. Despite the passing of\u00a0almost 2000 years , Trajan's Column stands firm and in perfect condition to remain part of Rome's eternity while continuing to tell its stories to visitors who come to see it.

By plane Rome has\u00a0two international airports with over 40 million passengers passing through the city every year. Traveling from the U.S. Visitors flying from the United States will find direct flights to Rome from New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Traveling from Canada Compared to the U.S., it's a little more difficult to find direct flights from Canada to Rome. However, there are flights from Toronto. Traveling from Australia Australia\u2019s main cities offer flights to Rome with one or more stops: Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Melbourne and Perth. Traveling from Europe If you live in Europe, it is now possible to visit the Italian capital for less than \u20ac 50 . Flight search engine -\u00a0Find and compare cheap flights online Once you have your ticket and know which airport you land in, find out how to get to the centre of Rome from Leonardo da Vinci Airport or Ciampino Airport: Rome Fiumicino Airport Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. Rome Ciampino Airport The Rome-Ciampino Airport (CIA) is the second most important airport in Rome. It is 7.5 miles from the centre and moves nearly 6 million passengers a year. Boat If you're coming from the Citavecchi port, you have three options: Take a day trip : This is the best way to see Rome in a day and to be sure to see the best of Rome in one day, and guarantee to be at the boat on time to embark. We offer an excursion to Rome from Civitavecchia with an English-speaking guide, and skip-the-line entry to St. Peter's Basilica. Reserve transport only : The price of the return transport from the port to the centre of Rome is \u20ac 25 per person, and it guarantees return in time for embarkment. Take a train : This is the cheapest, but least recommendable option. You'll have to walk to the Citiavecchia station, suffer an hour train ride, then take another means of transport once you arrive at the Termini train station. Train If you\u2019re planning on discovering Italy and visiting other cities, the train is an excellent option to keep in mind. The high-speed trains, called Frecciarossa, connect Rome and Florence in a little over an hour and a half and to Milan in three hours. There are also other categories of trains called Frecciargento or Frecciabianca, which also connect Rome with most cities in the country, but are slower. If you\u2019re touring Europe and would like to get to Rome by train, the easiest option is to get to Milan and from there take a train to Milan, You can check schedules and fares and even book online on the Ferrovie dello Stato website. Another option to arrive in Rome is to take the train from Naples . It's a great way to save money\u00a0and even gets you closer to Pompeii. Rome Termini Railway Station Termini Station is Rome\u2019s main railway station. Every day 480,000 travellers pass through its platforms, making it the busiest train station in Italy. Car If you\u2019d like to tour Europe by car and are thinking of getting to Rome by this means of transport, we recommend a stopover in Monaco, Genoa, Pisa and Florence, for example. Otherwise, the drive can be exhausting.

        "text":"Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Roman Republic was installed after the Roman kingdom was overthrown in 509 BC and lasted until 27 BC . One of the most important figures of this period is Julius Caesar . According to tradition, in 509 BC a series of essential events took place in the history of Rome : the last monarch was expelled, Rome was taken by Porsenna's army , the treaty between Rome and Carthage was signed, the Consular Fasti began and the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated . It seems like a lot of events for such a short time. The only one that belongs with certainty to the year 509 BC is the dedication of the temple of Jupiter. The other events may have taken place later, albeit within a short period of time. The Fasti consulares\u00a0(documents with the names of the consuls or magistrates that described the main events of the period) are essential for\u00a0understanding the Roman Republic from 503 BC, from when they are considered credible. Another very important method used to understand this period of Roman history is the ritual of the clavus annalis . This practice\u00a0began one year after the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated and it consisted in fixing a bronze nail to the right of the altar once a year. The first nail was placed in 508 BC. The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus had the cella of Jupiter, as well as the cella of Minerva and Juno. The decade after 509 BC (the year when the last King of Rome was dethroned, while he was away from Rome) is a dark period and very little is known, only isolated events. Transition\u00a0to the Roman Republic The transition of Rome from a monarchy to a republic led to severe internal social tensions . This lack of control over the city led neighbouring tribes to siege the city and reduce its power. This is why Rome had to ratify its identity on numerous occasions during the first 70 years of the Republic. The early years of the Republic are of political turmoil. The population was divided, certain wanted a monarchy, others a republic, others favoured the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, and others wanted to form part of the Latin civilisation. The nobles who had overthrown the king and his family had not come to an agreement regarding the type of government that would replace the monarchy. The consuls, which would later replace the leadership of the Roman kings, were\u00a0not put in place immediately, but many years later. Many historians believe that in the first stages of the Roman Republic, a praetor maximus was appointed for one year only. Later his duties would be split in two by choosing two consuls at a time to govern Rome. This form of government went on until 449 BC, with the Valeria Horaria law. The position of chief magistrate was not exclusively for the \u201c patres \u201d, who formed the Roman senate, and controlled the army and the priests since the time of Romulus , as there is evidence that shows plebeians, common civilians, becoming consuls up until 485 BC. The political instability led the strongest factions to form alliances between themselves. From 485 BC, the patricians no longer allowed commoners to take part in the government and began to control all civil and religious matters. Roman Law As well as the constant rivalry between patricians and plebeians, the Republic is also known as a period in which the power of Rome reached the whole peninsula of Italy and Roman law was founded\u00a0with the Law of the Twelve Tables in 450 BC. Moreover, it was\u00a0also a period when many wars took place for equality between the Roman inhabitants. The Twelve Tables\u00a0were written up to appease the demands of the commoners. Until the Tables were written, Roman law had had a sacred character, as it had been linked to the monarchy and the college of pontiffs. With its drafting, Roman law was desacralised and became the basis of the law of the Western world. According to the historian Titus Livy, the Twelve Tables were the source of all Roman law, both public and private . Between the years 133 BC and 27 BC, Rome suffered from great internal tensions, leading to numerous civil wars. The Graco brothers, who proposed a series of laws in favour of the plebeians, also led to a social crisis in Rome. Dictatorship: Transition from the Republic to the Roman Empire The big step towards a political system in which power was accumulated in the hands of a single person was taken by Sulla (dictator in the years 82-79) . Sulla's systematisation was very important and one of the consequences, which greatly influenced politics and the very end of the Republic, was the fact that he concentrated all political power in the hands of the Senate, which was not the case with the executive government . This meant that the Senate had to entrust the executive to a natural-born leader, a general who was also a politician. At the same time, the Populares also wanted to occupy power, leading to a strengthening of personal power in governing. The strengthening of personalism led to the triumvirate and the dictatorships of Julius Caesar or Augustus\u00a0and marked the end of the Republic and the beginning of a new era, the Empire .

The temple is famous since it houses the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden figure of the Child Jesus, which is said to be miraculous. History Located south of the Capitoline Hill, Santa Maria in Aracoeli was built during the sixth century on the site of an ancient Byzantine abbey. During the ninth century\u00a0the church was given to the Benedictines, and a few centuries later, was given to the Franciscans. These restored the church giving it a more Gothic aspect. In 1797, during the Republic, the church was deconsecrated and\u00a0transformed into a stable. Nowadays, the basilica has been fully reconstructed and is one of the most visited in Rome. The interior Millions of tourists and locals visit the church to see the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden image of the Christ Child, who is believed to resurrect the dead. The statue, made out of olive wood during the fifteenth century, was stolen in 1994 and was never recovered. A replica was made to substitute it. The temple has 22 columns, none exactly alike, which were taken from Roman ruins.\u00a0It is also worth seeing various burials and frescoes from the fifteenth century. The wooden ceiling is decorated with paintings representing the Battle of Lepanto, where the Holy League defeated the fleet of the Ottoman Empire. Aracoeli staircase The Aracoeli staircase was completed in 1348 to celebrate the end of the Black Death in Rome. It is a marble staircase made up of 124 steep steps that finish at the entrance of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. It is believed that all those who climb the stairs on their knees will win the lottery. In the heart of the city The Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli is extremely well located, in the heart of the city, near the Altare della Patria .\u00a0Therefore, stopping for a quick visit is very popular among visitors.

Book this guided tour Palatine Hill is considered to be the birthplace of the Italian capital and is believed to have been inhabited since the year 1000 B.C . During the Republican Period, Roman citizens belonging to the upper class settled in Palatine Hill and built sumptuous palaces , of which important traces are still preserved. According to the legend Roman mythology talks of the cave that was inhabited by Luperca, the she-wolf that took care of Romulus and Remus , which is located on Palatine Hill . According to the legend, when the brothers grew up they decided to form a city on the banks of the river, but when they could not come to an agreement on some points of the decision, Romulus killed Remus and founded the city of Rome . What to see on Palatine Hill On Palatine Hill, you can see hundreds of ruins of imposing buildings that were created for high Roman society in ancient times. Although the whole scene is impressive, these are some of the points that deserve special attention : Domus Flavia : The splendid palace Domus Flavia was built in the year 81 B.C . by the order of Emperor Domitian as a public and official residence. There are still some parts of the extensive construction that can be seen. House of Livia : This modestly-built house which was built in the 1st century B.C. is one of the best-preserved buildings in Palatine Hill. It's still possible to glimpse the remains of the mosaics and frescoes that at one time cheered up the ceilings and walls. House of Augustus : Built as the private residence of Octavian Augustus, the house built on two levels still has a large part of the valued and colorful frescoes that decorated its walls. Farnese Gardens : Designed in the middle of the 16th century on the ruins of the Palace of Tiberius, the Farnese Gardens were one of the first botanical gardens to be created in Europe. Hippodrome of Domitian : Given the appearance of a Roman circus, it's not known for certain if the stadium was created for holding races, or just to be used as a garden. Palatine museum : In this small museum, several discoveries that were made during excavations carried out on Palatine Hill are on exhibition. There are sculptures, frescoes, mosaics, and other objects belonging to the golden age of Palatine Hill. From Palatine Hill, you can get the best views of the Roman Forum from above . A walk in Ancient Rome Palatine Hill is a very pleasant place for a quiet stroll under the shadow of the trees while passing many of the preserved corners of ancient Rome. It's worth dedicating half a day to visit it since the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill each cover a very large space that should be very interesting . Guided Visits to Skip the Lines The best way to visit while skipping the lines is to reserve our tour , visiting the three main monuments in the city: Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill - all with a specialist guide. If you prefer visiting at your own pace, we recommend arriving first thing in the morning to visit the Vatican . This way you can hopefully avoid longer lines.

Established by Pope Julius II during the sixteenth century, it houses thousands of works of art. Book a tour The origins of these museums go back to 1503 , the year in which the recently named Pope Julius II donated his private collection. Since that moment private families and other popes have enlarged the collection of the museums to the point where it has become one of the largest in the world . At present, the Vatican Museums receive more than 6 million visitors annually , partly due to the fact\u00a0that they form the entrance to the Sistine Chapel . What museums are there in the interior? Pio-Clementino Museum : Created thanks to the popes Clement XIV and Pius VI, this museum holds the most important Greek works in the Vatican. Apartment of Pius V : The work of Pope Pius V, this museum contains Flemish tapestries from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a collection of medieval ceramics, and another of medieval miniature mosaics. Gallery of the Chandeliers : Roman replicas of Greek originals and enormous chandeliers from the second century A.D. decorate this elegant gallery. Ethnological Missionary Museum : This museum contains works of art from all the papal missions of the world, among which there are objects originating from Tibet, Indonesia, India, the Far East, Africa, and America. Gallery of Maps : Carried out between the years 1580 and 1585, the beautiful maps painted in fresco on the walls of this gallery represent the Italian regions and the possessions of the Church. Historical Museum - Carriage Pavilion : In this section, you'll find coaches, saddles, cars, and even Vatican City's first locomotive. Gallery of Tapestries : Exhibition of Flemish tapestries created between 1523 and 1534. Pio-Christian Museum : The collection of Christian antiquities is composed of statues, sarcophagi, and archaeological ruins from the sixth century. Pinacoteca : The eighteen rooms in the Pinacoteca building contain pictorial works dating from the Middle Ages until 1800. Sobieski Room and the Room of the Immaculate : In both rooms, you'll find paintings originating in the Italian \"Ottocento\". Egyptian Museum : Among other pieces acquired by the popes you can find some impressive Egyptian sculptures, besides the prized sarcophagi from the third century B.C. There are also some black basalt statues originating from the Villa Adriana , which are replicas of Egyptian models. Etruscan museum : This part of the museum contains elements of ceramic, bronze, and gold belonging to the Etruscan civilization. Chiaramonti Museum : Created thanks to Pius VII Chiaramonti, this gallery holds thousands of sculptures including portraits of emperors, images of the gods, and some funeral monuments. Gregorian Profane Museum : Its rooms hold Greek and Roman sculptures from the first to third centuries A.D. Borgia Apartment : The apartments that belonged to Pope Alexander VI Borgia today serve as exhibition rooms for the Collection of Modern Religious Art. Raphael Rooms : Rafael and his assistants decorated the apartments of Pope Julius II with unparalleled taste. Sala Della Biga : A monumental figure of marble of a chariot drawn by two horses carried out in the first century A.D. fills the space and gives the room its name. Skip the lines The queue to enter the Vatican Museums is undoubtedly the longest in Rome. We could say that, of all Europe, the Eiffel Tower is the only monument that can compete with them. The other way to avoid the lines is to book an English-speaking\u00a0guided tour of the Vatican . This way you'll see the most interesting landmarks and learn about the fascinating history of the Vatican City, as you follow your guide straight in without having to queue. If you prefer to visit on your own, we recommend avoiding a visit on the last Sunday of each month (the free day) and during the Easter holiday . It is also advisable to avoid weekends, especially in high season. In our experience, the best time to go is on weekdays at 1\u00a0pm . Most people tend to come first thing in the morning to avoid the lines, so this is often the time when you'll have to wait the longest. In our experience, the best time to go is around 13:00 on weekdays, as most people tend to crowd in early in the morning to avoid the queues.

The exhibits The Palazzo Altemps houses an important collection of Greek and Roman sculpture that belonged to several families of the Roman nobility between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The works are on display in beautiful rooms decorated with frescoes on the walls and ceilings. The figures belonging to the Altemps Collection are also on display in the lovely patio and next to the monumental staircase. Although Cardinal Altemps\u2019s collection includes over 100 works, many of them are displayed in other museums, such as the Louvre. The Boncompagni Ludovisi collection spans most of the museum. It consists of more than 100 works, including The Galatian Suicide and the remarkable Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus. The palace also displays a major collection of Egyptian art, as well as collections that belonged to the Mattei and Del Drago families. Perhaps one of the most striking parts of the museum is the Church of San Aniceto, a small and pleasant church located within the building. A mandatory visit The Palazzo Altemps is one of the best museums in Rome , and it has the added advantage of its entry fee being included with that of the other branches of the National Museum of Rome.

Built in the neighbourhood of Trastevere on the orders of a banker from Siena, the villa owes its name to its subsequent owner, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Touring Villa Farnesina The building consists of a central block, two small wings, and two floors. The interior of the villa is surprisingly richly decorated with frescoes by major artists, such as Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and Peruzzi . On the first floor there are particularly striking frescoes of the Sala di Galatea, one of Raphael\u2019s most important works. When observing the ceiling, one can see astrological paintings showing the position of the stars on the day of the birth of Chigi, the villa\u2019s first owner. On the upper floor there is another one of the villa\u2019s most beautiful rooms, the Sala delle Prospettive. The room\u2019s d\u00e9cor is based on the optical illusion created by the frescoes that show the city of Rome through the marble columns . Remarkable decor Villa Farnesina is an important manifestation of the luxury and opulence that predominated in Italian society during the Renaissance period . Although the building is of unremarkable size and its exterior is not particularly striking , the reason for visiting lies in the frescoes that cover the ceilings and walls that decorate the interior of the villa. Comparisons are odious, and the paintings of Villa Farnesina are excellent, but they are of little interest when compared to the Borghese Gallery , a\u00a0beautifully decorated building that also houses different works of art.

        "text":"Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - The ancient church in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore The Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore is an ancient Catholic basilica that is considered to be the largest of the churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Rome. It is one of the city\u2019s four major basilicas. Going back in time Built on a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Cybele, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore was built in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Pope Liberius. According to legend, the Virgin appeared before the Pope with the instructions for building the church, and the shape of the floor was designed based on a miraculous snowfall. Over the years, the basilica has had many different names, such as Saint Mary of the Snow (due to snow that led to the church\u2019s shape), Santa Maria Liberiana (for Pope Liberius), St. Mary of the Nativity (because it received a relic of the Holy Nativity), and it was finally called Santa Maria Maggiore, as it is the largest of the 26 churches in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Inside The basilica displays varied architectural styles, from early Christian to Baroque. The entire building was restored and renovated during the eighteenth century, so the facade and much of the interior date from that period. Despite this, the church retains the bell tower, some mosaics and marble floors from the medieval period and some Ionic columns from other ancient Roman buildings, as well as splendid fifth-century mosaics. The ceiling decoration has been preserved from the Renaissance period, while the domes and chapels belong to the Baroque era. A successful mix of styles Probably the most striking aspect of the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore is the different parts belonging to such varied periods of history. As if it were made up of remnants, the church summarizes the most important stages of Christian art in Rome.

        "text":"Romulus and Remus - The founding of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Romulus and Remus There are several fascinating legends and myths about how the city of Rome was founded, all collected by the Italian historian, Tito Livio . The Legend of Romulus and Remus Legend has it that Ascanio, son of the Trojan hero\u00a0Aeneas (son of Venus and Anchises), founded the city of Alba Longa on the right bank of the river Tiber. Many of Aeneas' descendants\u00a0reigned this settlement peacefully. When Nimitor was king, his brother Amulius seized power\u00a0and dethroned Nimitor, killing his male heirs and forcing his daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin so that she would not provide a male heir to the throne. Nevertheless, Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins, Romulus and Remus, whose father was thought to be Mars, the god of War. Amulius imprisoned the daughter and condemned the babies to death by drowning in the river Tiber. However, the servant in charge of the task took pity on them and instead placed the twins into a basket and pushed them down the River Tiber. They were safely carried to the area of the seven hills. There, the boys were found by a she-wolf called Lupa who nursed them in her lair in Palatine Hill until they were found by a shepherd and his wife, who raised them as shepherds. As adults, Romulus and Remus were two natural-born\u00a0leaders and in a fight killed King Amulius and reinstated Nimitor as king of Alba Longa. Seeking to establish their own settlement, Romulus finally built a wall around Palatine Hill, the location he had chosen for the founding of Rome. The she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus is said to have been their human foster mother . The term wolf, in Latin lupa, was also used,\u00a0in a derogatory sense, for the prostitutes of the time. When seeking the perfect location for their new city, the twins wandered across the seven hills (Aventine, Celio, Capitol, Esquiline, Palatine , Quirinal and Viminal). Remus wished to start the city on Aventine Hill, while Romulus preferred Palatine Hill . In order to decide which brother was right\u00a0they agreed to consult augury, where birds are examined to see what the gods favoured. Remus claimed to have seen six birds, whereas his brother had seen twelve. Even though Romulus had seen more birds, Remus argued that he had seen them first and therefore the city should be built on the Aventine Hill. Meanwhile, Romulus began to build a wall on his hill, which Remus decided to jump over. Angered by his brother\u2019s action, Romulus killed him . According to the legend, this took place in 754 BC. The Legend of Aeneas According to another legend, the Trojan prince, Aeneas, reached the Italian coast and married Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus, thus becoming king . This myth is not only told by Greek historians, but is defended in Italy compared to other legends that give Rome an Arcadian origin, related to the myth of Evandro, or Achaean, related to Odysseus or Ulysses. The myth of Aeneas gives Rome a divine and Greek founding . However, the tradition of a Trojan origin of Rome cannot be considered admissible if you compare\u00a0the date of the destruction of Troy (1200 BC) with the archaeological remains of the settlement of Latium and Septimontium, similar to many other Late Bronze Age settlements in Italy and far from being a major settlement, let alone a city.

        "text":"Roman Forum - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there \u2013 Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Roman Forum Located between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum, the Roman Forum was the hub\u00a0of political and social activity of the Roman citizens. Book a Tour The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place . The Forum is, along with the Colosseum , the greatest sign of the splendor of the Roman Empire that can be seen today. After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that excavations were carried out. Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima , one of the first sewer systems in the world. Points of interest Besides the great number of temples that are in the forum (Saturn, Venus, Romulus, Vesta, etc.), it's worth paying special attention to the following points of interest: Via Sacra : This was the main street in ancient Rome that linked the Piazza del Campidoglio with the Colosseum. Arch of Titus : This is a triumphal arch that commemorates Rome's victory over Jerusalem. It was built after the death of the emperor Titus. Arch of Septimius Severus : An arch erected in the year 203 A.D. to commemorate the third anniversary of Septimius Severus as the emperor. Temple of Antoninus and Faustina : Built in the second century, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina sets itself apart as the best-preserved temple in the Roman Forum. Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine : Though now mostly destroyed, its size suggests that this was one of the most important buildings of the Roman Forum. The Curia : In this building, the Senate met to make administrative decisions about the Roman government. Column of Phocas : Erected in the year 608 A.D. in honor of the emperor of Byzantium, this column, which is over 13 meters high,\u00a0is one of the few that have remained standing since being built. A must-see Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower . As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there . The Roman Forum is one of the most beautiful and interesting places in the city, making it easy to spend hours strolling through its various temples without getting bored. Skip the Lines The best way to skip the line and get to know the Forum in detail is to take a guided tour . We'll visit three of the main monuments in the city, the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill, skipping the line, and all with an expert guide. If you prefer to discover it on your own, we recommend that you head first thing in the morning, as this is when people head to visit the Vatican .

Hail cabs that have a telephone number written on the sides of the vehicle, which means that they work for a taxi company. If you have any problem, write down the taxi\u2019s license plate number (it is always at the back of the front seat) and call the taxi company. If at any point you think you are being swindled, don\u2019t let the taxi driver intimidate you and call the Carabinieri. Additionally, it is always a good idea to ask for a receipt and complain to the taxi company. Taxi companies Although the cheapest way to catch a cab is by waiting at the official taxi stops on the streets of Rome, it is also possible to reserve this type of transportation by telephone. These are some of the best taxi companies in the city: Radio Taxi : 06-3570. Pronto Taxi : 06-6645. Other companies: 06-5551, 06-4994, 06-4157.

Erected between 1568 and 1584, Il Ges\u00f9 was the first Jesuit church built in Rome. It was lavishly decorated during the seventeenth century. Nowadays, the Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Chiesa del Ges\u00f9) is considered to be one of the best examples of Roman Baroque architecture. In its interior Il Ges\u00fa was built with small chapels instead of aisles, designed specially so that the members of the church are all facing the main altar. One of the most striking parts of the temple\u00a0is the ceiling fresco painted by Baciccia (Giovanni Battista Gaulli). The fresco manages to look three-dimensional thanks to the wooden figures and stuccos added to the fresco. Located in the chapel of the Madonna della Strada there is a small icon of the Madonna della Strada. The icon was built on the same site as Il Ges\u00f9 and dates from the fifteenth century. It had originally been part of the church, which has the same name. The Chapel St Ignatius of Loyola (founder of the Jesuits) is a prime example of Roman Baroque architecture. In this chapel, the tomb of the saint is decorated with silver, gold, bronze, marble and some special stones. In the right transept\u00a0is the altar of Saint Francis Xavier, one of the founders of the Jesuits. The altar features Jesus with St Ignatius and it has a silver reliquary with part of the saint\u2019s right arm. In the heart of the city Il Ges\u00f9 is not one of the most impressive churches in Rome, but its decoration and chapels are interesting to see.

The Piazza della Repubblica is made up of a large roundabout with an exquisite fountain, surrounded by imposing buildings on one side and a seemingly demolished temple on the other. It was formerly known as the Piazza dell'Esedra because it was laid down on the remains of an exedra (a semi-circular open room with seating) from the Diocletian era. Fontana delle Naiadi At the centre of the Piazza della Repubblica stands the majestic Fontana delle Naiadi . It was constructed between 1870 and 1888 and decorated with four lion sculptures. In 1901 the lions were replaced by the statues of four nude Naiads (water nymphs). Their nudity was subject of much controversy at the time.

        "text":"Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls Erected during the fourth century AD, the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls (Basilica di San Paolo Fuori le Mura) is one of the four major basilicas of Rome, and the second largest after St. Peter's Basilica . It was founded on the burial ground of St. Paul. Architecture When Paul the Apostle was executed in the first century AD in Rome, his followers built a shrine over his grave. In 324 a small church was consecrated on the same grounds, which was later demolished in 386 to make space for the construction of a larger and more beautiful basilica, completed in 395. The monastery\u2019s striking cloister was built between 1220 and 1241. The cloister is\u00a0one of the few parts of the Basilica which survived the fire of 1823. After the fire, many countries made donations for the restoration of the church, which was reopened in 1840. The temple was later declared a national monument. Interior The interior of the Basilica of St. Paul is magnificent, with enormous marble columns and beautiful gold mosaics. Unfortunately, because of the fire of 1823, few parts of the Medieval basilica remain intact. However, the church still houses some mosaics from the thirteenth century, a large twelfth-century chandelier, and the marble tombstone under which the remains of St. Paul lie. On the basilica\u2019s walls, visitors will be able to observe the portraits of each of the popes, while a ray of sunlight lights up the portrait of the current Pope, Pope Francis. The atrium located in the exterior is one of the most noteworthy parts of the church. It is made up of 150 columns, and from here, visitors can see the fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica covered by an enormous golden mosaic built between 1854 and 1874, which\u00a0reflects the rays of sunlight. The centre of the portico houses a colossal statue of St. Paul. A little far away, but a must-see Although the Basilica isn\u2019t in the heart of the city, we recommend visiting this unique and astonishing church in order to see its impressive mosaics, atrium and interior. It is one of the best churches in\u00a0Rome.

Rome in summer July is the hottest month of the year in Rome, although August is nearly as hot, with average temperatures of 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Due to the high humidity, visiting the city during these months can be a little stifling. In August, many shops close and many locals leave on vacation. The Best Time of Year to Visit Rome The city of Rome can be discovered the whole year round . However, if you can, we recommend going in spring or\u00a0autumn, when there are normally fewer\u00a0hordes of tourists. However, if you don\u2019t like large crowds, avoid visiting the city during Easter as this is when Rome has the largest amount of travellers. In autumn, it is more likely to rain than in spring. Language Public Holidays You may also be interested in Language Although the official language spoken in Rome\u00a0is Italian, travellers will find that many locals speak English, especially those who work in restaurants, hotels\u00a0and other places associated with tourism. Public Holidays It\u2019s always interesting to find out the public holidays of the place you\u2019re travelling to beforehand. This allows you to make the most of holidays\u00a0and also gives you an idea of when museums and other places of interest are closed.

        "text":"Santa Maria del Popolo - Opening hours and entrance \u2013 Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria del Popolo Standing on the Piazza del Popolo , near the northern gate of the Aurelian Wall, the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo is a small temple with splendid Renaissance decoration in its interior. Its origins The origins of the basilica are very unusual. A legend had it that the site where the church was eventually erected\u00a0was haunted by the ghost of Nero, a Roman Emperor who reigned from 54 to 68 AD. On his burial ground had grown a bewitched walnut tree full of crows. To put an end to this myth, Pope Paschal II in 1099 ordered the tree to be cut down and commissioned a Romanesque chapel to be built instead. The chapel was enlarged in 1227 and later reconstructed between 1472 and 1477. In 1513, various of the most influential artists of the period, like Pinturicchio, Raphael, Caravaggio and Bernini were requested to decorate the walls and ceilings of the temple. In its interior Santa Maria del Popolo\u2019s decoration is unlike any other church in Rome . The ceiling, less high than most built during the same period, is practically bare, while the decoration of each of the small chapels is especially remarkable. Among the beautiful artwork found in the church, it is worth highlighting the Chapel Cerasi, which houses two canvases by Caravaggio from 1600, and the Chapel Chigi, built and decorated by Raphael. If you look closely at the wooden benches, you\u2019ll be able to see inscriptions with the names of the people the benches\u00a0are dedicated to. This custom is also found in a lot of English-speaking countries like Scotland or\u00a0Edinburgh, where the families of the person deceased buy urban furniture in their honour. Not like any other church in Rome In Rome\u00a0it is possible to visit an infinite number of churches, therefore it is worth reading a little about each church and selecting a few that appear most appealing to you, so\u00a0as not to visit too many. The Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo is one of those that are definitely worth visiting, not because of its structure or its fa\u00e7ade, but because of its impressively decorated chapels.

History The Piazza Campo dei Fiori, which was once a field of flowers, and thus the name, was paved in 1456 under Pope Callistus III. Thanks to the prominent buildings surrounding the piazza, such as Palazzo Orsini , the Campo de\u2019 Fiori became a very popular part of Rome frequented by the most influential historical figures. Its popularity drew new businesses to the area, opening workshops, inns and taverns making this neighborhood one of the most prosperous of the city. Moreover, Campo de\u2019 Fiori was the location where a horse market took place twice a week. Public executions took place in this square , which is nowadays commemorated by the impressive statue of Giordano Bruno, in the centre of the piazza. The Italian philosopher was burnt at the stake in 1600 for heresy. The monument was built in his honour in 1889. Twenty-first century Campo de\u2019 Fiori The Campo de\u2019 Fiori is currently one of the most beloved parts of the city . Since 1869, every morning from Monday through Saturday it houses a market well-known for its flowers and fruit and vegetable.

It's known as much for its decoration, as for being the temple in which popes are chosen and crowned. The construction of the building was carried out between 1473 and 1481 during the mandate of Pope Sixtus IV , to whom it owes its current name. The architect responsible for the construction was Giovanni of Dolci and it's the only work that he is remembered for. The most striking thing about\u00a0the Sistine Chapel is not its architecture, but the frescoes that completely cover the walls and the ceiling. Some of the most important artists who worked in the chapel are Botticelli, Perugino, Luca, and Michelangelo . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel All of the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are the work of Michelangelo , who spent four years painting the vault between 1508 and 1512. If there is one thing that stands out from among the images on the ceiling, it's the nine stories from Genesis that occupy the central area : The scenes from the Drunkenness of Noah to the Separation of Light from Darkness are represented. The Creation of Adam Without any doubt, The Creation of Adam is the best-known image from the Sistine Chapel . It's located in the central part of the vault and represents the story from Genesis in which God gives life to Adam. The Final Judgment Located over the high altar and with some magnificent dimensions (13.7 by 12.2 meters), Michelangelo\u2019s other masterpiece , The Final Judgment, is found. It's a fresco that represents the Apocalypse of St. John. Decorating the apse occupied five years of Michelangelo\u2019s life, between 1536 and 1541 . It was an assignment of Pope Paul III to cover the murals that existed to that point. Skip the lines If you're visiting the Sistine Chapel, you'll have to visit the Vatican museums, the most popular attraction in Rome and Europe. The best way to do this is to take a combo tour that takes in the\u00a0Basilica, Vatican Museums, and the Sistine Chapel, with a local guide, we recommend reserving a guided tour of the Vatican so you can make the most of the attraction. If you hope to visit on your own, the best time is to go at 1 pm . We don't recommend going on the first Sunday of the month (when it's free) or over Easter .

The mansion houses valuable works by great masters such as Raphael , Tiziano , Caravaggio , Brueghel the Elder , Velazquez and Bernini . The Exhibitions The Galleria Doria Pamphilj collection was started by Pope Innocent X Pamphilj in 1644. It currently consists of over 400 paintings dating from the 15th to the 18th century . Oddly, the paintings are in an order that has not changed over the course of time . This can be proven through an\u00a018th-century document that details the exact placement of each one of the paintings. One of the most noteworthy works in the gallery is the Portrait of Pope Innocent X , by Vel\u00e1zquez , which shows the pope exactly as he was : an ominous and distrustful man . This led to a great deal of controversy at the time of its painting, given that other artists purported to idealize the pontiff\u2019s characteristics in order to soften his sinister visage. Despite the painting\u2019s realism, the Pamphilj family keeps it in a special place, and it has had its own room since the 19th century. In addition to the full gallery, within the palace, you can also visit a small chapel and several private rooms that maintain their original decor and part of their furniture . Not Worth Visiting The Palazzo Doria Pamphilj maintains a good deal of its original decor and showcases a large amount of artwork. Nevertheless, the entry fee is too expensive relative to the quality of the exhibits . Rome has important galleries that are superior to the Galleria Pamphilj.

Interesting facts The name Cosmedin comes from the Greek word \u201ckosmidion\u201d, meaning ornamented, thanks to its beautifully decorated interior. Nowadays, the church is practically bare, although it still has some magnificent elements such as the floor mosaics,\u00a0the bishop\u2019s chair, the baldachin and the medieval choir enclosure. Another treasure worth discovering is the glass shrine with the skull of St Valentine, patron saint of love, located on the left side of the church. The restored Medieval fa\u00e7ade has a portico with seven arches, in which\u00a0visitors queue to place their hand in the mouth of the legendary Bocca della Verit\u00e0 (Mouth of Truth). Legend has it that if a person places his or her hand in the mouth of the statue and lies, the mouth will close and cut their hand off. Next to the church\u2019s porch is an impressive Romanesque bell tower built during the twelfth century. Crypt The crypt, constructed in the eighth century, is located beneath the altar and was built to store the relics taken from the catacombs by Pope Adrian I. The crypt is shaped like a small basilica. The side walls have several niches, each with shelves made of marble, where the different relics are displayed.

Don't miss visiting the forced perspective gallery by Francesco Borromini. Galer\u00eda Spada Collection of the Galleria Spada 2 See photo gallery Located in an exquisite palazzo built in the mid-sixteenth century, the Galleria Spada houses a small collection of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The most fascinating part of the mansion is the forced perspective gallery by Borromini. Exhibitions The collection, largely assembled by Cardinal Bernardino Spada, is made up of different pieces of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Spada family was deeply interested in collecting and promoting the art of the period. One of the gallery\u2019s main attractions is found in the courtyard. The Italian artist Francesco Borromini created the forced perspective gallery, a gallery measuring 9 metres long. However,\u00a0thanks to an architectural trick, it creates a visual optical illusion of a 40 metre gallery. As the walls of the room narrow, the floor rises and the height decreases so that the small sculpture which is placed at the end of the gallery seems larger. The collection is divided into four halls, as they would be during the seventeenth century, with the small paintings hung on the top floor and the larger pictures placed on the ground floor. It gives the impression that the paintings are hung in a strange order. For a second visit to Rome Although Borromini\u2019s forced perspective gallery is rather impressive, especially for the period, we recommend visiting other museums before Galleria Spada. This could be a good option for a second visit to Rome.

The Ara Pacis is an altar located in the interior of a closed structure carved in Carrara marble. It\u00a0stands out because of its impressive decoration made up of various reliefs showing the family of Augustus in procession, in addition to different allegories related to the mythical foundation of Rome. Ara Pacis in the past Erected in the Campus Martius, the monument was dedicated to the Roman goddess of Peace. Each year, a ram and two oxen were sacrificed in the goddess's honor. The altar was located in such a way that the shadow of the great obelisk located in the Campus Martius was projected on the Ara Pacis on the birthday of Augustus. Due to the expansion of the river,\u00a0the altar was submerged in mud, where it remained for more than one millennium. It was not until the 16th century that some of the remains were found and in 1938 its reconstruction was carried out, preserving it until the present day. Ara Pacis today Although the Ara Pacis is one of the most significant monuments of Ancient Rome, it's the only thing that is exhibited in the interior of the museum, making an entrance ticket quite expensive. It's best to look at the altar from the outside, as the building that contains it is made of glass. Ara Pacis Altar of Augustan Peace 2 See photo gallery Location Lungotevere en Augusta.

Book this guided tour A little history Construction of the building began in the year 135 under the direction of the Emperor Hadrian , who intended to use it as mausoleum for himself and his family . It was finished in the year 139 and a short time later, it became a military building, which in the year 403 would be integrated to the Aurelian Walls. In the year 590, while a great epidemic of plague devastated the city, the Pope Gregory I had a vision of Saint Michael the Archangel on top of the castle, announcing the end of the epidemic. In memory of the apparition the building is crowned with a statue of an angel. In the year 1277 an 800 metre fortified corridor was built that connected the castle with the Vatican City so that the Pope could escape in the event that he were in danger. During the sieges that occurred in Rome during 1527, the Pope Clement VII used the fortress as a refuge . The castle today The Castel Sant'Angelo is split into five floors which can be reached by a spiral ramp that first reaches the chamber of ashes and subsequently the cells in which a number of historical figures were incarcerated . Advancing toward the upper part of the castle you will find different rooms that functioned as a Papal residence , decorated with perfectly preserved frescoes from the Renaissance period , besides the extensive collection of weapons .

        "text":"Pompeii - Review, opening hours & how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Pompeii Pompeii was an ancient Roman city near modern Naples that was buried by the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Book a Day Trip Pompeii was the ancient city of Rome that was totally destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD. Since it was engulfed so quickly by a wall of volcanic mud, the city is extremely well preserved. Pompeii still has most of its buildings, streets, and even the volcano\u2019s victims who died instantly and are preserved in ash. The Tragic Story of Pompeii The city is believed to have been founded by the Osci or the Oscans during the seventh century BC. Over the years the city prospered and grew with villas, monuments, and gardens. Pompeii was thriving when in 62 AD it was hit by a severe earthquake, damaging the city. While the city\u2019s inhabitants were still reconstructing the city after the earthquake, as it's believed that almost all the buildings had been affected, in 79 AD\u00a0a tragic event that would annihilate the town completely took place.\u00a0On 24 August, Mount Vesuvius erupted covering Pompeii in ash. On the following morning, a river of volcanic mud enveloped the city. The remains lay forgotten until they were rediscovered in the sixteenth century. Excavations of Pompeii began in 1748 and over 45 hectares have since been unearthed. What to see Pompeii is very large, and tourists can visit numerous buildings in which residents went about their everyday lives, including some temples, the basilica, the forum, and baths, as well as some of the most lavish homes decorated with frescoes and mosaics. One of the most unusual buildings is the Lupanar, a brothel containing rudimentary stone beds as well as frescoes with erotic images. Many of the archaeological remains, including many of the bodies buried under layers of ash, are preserved in the Horrea and Olitorium. Visitors will be able to see how the citizens would cross the roads using enormous stone crosswalks so that they wouldn\u2019t get muddy. Heart-stirring Pompeii was a fascinating city and it's surprising to find it so well preserved. The town seems to still be inhabited since most of the buildings are just as they were when the volcano erupted. Even the paintings, frescoes, and other decorative elements of the houses are intact. Probably one of the most hair-raising parts of the visit\u00a0is the display of the victims of the explosion, which depicts the terror they felt seconds before dying. Getting to Pompeii The three main ways to get to Pompeii from Rome are: Booking a guided tour : This is the easiest way of getting to Pompeii. It includes a hotel pickup, transport there and back, a guided tour in English, admission tickets, and food. Train : To get to Pompeii by train\u00a0visitors will have to take a train from Termini station to Naples, and once there, take the Circumvesuviana line to Pompei i . It can take between 2 and 3 hours to get there. The price can vary from \u20ac 30 and \u20ac 100 for a return trip, depending on the train you choose to take. Car rental : This is the cheapest option if you\u2019re traveling with friends or family. However, keep in mind the price of the tolls, petrol and the time it takes to hire a car. We recommend this option to those who want to rent a car to visit other nearby cities .

The exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum pays tribute to a versatile and profound artist. Visitors will see not only his well-known photographs and series, but also lesser-known work. Videos, sculptures, advertising material, and pieces from his personal archive are on display. The exhibition concludes with his final, unfinished video work. Erwin Olaf \u2013 Freedom Dates Fri 19 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 Sat 20 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 Sun 21 Dec 10:00 - 18:00 More dates Location Stedelijk Museum - Museum of Modern Art , Museumplein 10 , 1071 DJ Amsterdam Show in Google Maps A journey through his career It begins with his black-and-white photos from the early 1980s. He took these photos spontaneously on the streets, such as at gay rights demonstrations. They already reveal his commitment to society. Erwin Olaf loved light and beautiful composition. He wanted more control over his photographs and therefore began working in the studio. The exhibition features many of these studio photographs, both well-known and lesser-known. They come from series such as Ladies Hats (1985-2022), Chessmen (1987-88), Royal Blood (2000), Grief (2007), Fashion Victims (2000), Berlin (2012), and Skin Deep (2015). His commissions are also on display, such as SM in Holland (1989) and photographs he made for the Netherlands Dance Theatre and the National Ballet. Freethinker Erwin Olaf Springveld (1959\u20132023) was a renowned Dutch photographer and artist. He was internationally acclaimed for his unique working method: his photographs were carefully composed, with striking lighting and a keen eye for detail. Olaf was a freethinker. Personal freedom was always central to him. In his work, he demonstrated the importance of being yourself. He created art that explored topics such as identity, sexuality, gender, the human body, nightlife, and equal rights for everyone. His critical and proactive attitude toward society is a key theme in his work. This is clearly reflected in the exhibition about his life and art. It is structured around various themes, but also shows how his work has evolved over the years.

Whether you're looking for the best places to cycle in Amsterdam or planning to join a guided bike tour, knowing the essential cycling rules and practising safe cycling is key. So grab a bike and experience Amsterdam like a local! Cycling in Amsterdam Play video Amsterdam: a cycling city Image from Oleh Slobodeniuk via iStock The narrow, winding streets of Amsterdam's historic 17th-century city centre are definitely best navigated by bike. And with up to 400 kilometres of bicycle paths leading just about everywhere in town, it's no wonder that Amsterdam is a true cycling city. Renting a bike or taking a guided cycle tour is a great way to discover the city and can be quite an adventure. Plus, if you're inexperienced or nervous about traffic, the expert guides and rental shops can set you up and offer great advice. Bike rentals in Amsterdam Image from Roos Trommelen Photography Bicycles can be rented in all parts of the city. Especially around Central Station, Leidseplein and hotels, you can find many rental companies. Bike rental is often possible from 3 hours per day, the average daily rental price is \u20ac10. Locals find nothing more irritating than a lousy cyclist, so make sure you follow the (unwritten) rules of the road! Check out all bike hire locations .

There are shortcuts and detours for extra special attractions.\u00a0All routes are offered in the (free) route planner tool Komoot. Rules for safe cycling in Amsterdam Image from Alain Rouiller Cycling in the city can be hectic, especially if you're not used to Amsterdam-style traffic. Here are a few things to keep in mind after you hire a bicycle: Stay in your lane: use the bicycle lane on the right-hand side of the road, marked out by white lines and bike symbols. Follow the rules of the road: adhere to all traffic lights and signs; don\u2019t cycle on footpaths, shopping streets, pavements and motorways. It\u2019s required by law to use front and back lights on your bicycle after dark. Give a sign: always signal before turning by putting your hand out. Watch out for tram rails: it\u2019s easy to get your tires stuck in the rails \u2013 cross them at a sharp angle. Park it right: make sure to park your bike in a designated bike parking section, rack or indoor parking facility, as bikes that are not parked in the right areas may be removed and stored in the Bicycle Depot. And to avoid theft, lock your bike to something secure and immovable. Make room for fellow cyclists: don\u2019t bike more than two people across, keep pace with the other cyclists, and pull over to answer your phone or check the map. Avoid rush hour : between 08:00 and 09:00 or 17:00 and 18:00, thousands of bikes are on the road, often resulting in big queues at junctions. If you don't need to be somewhere, wait until the rush calms down. Don\u2019t imitate the Dutch: Amsterdammers are notorious for breaking the rules: cycling through red lights or biking at night without lights. Do not follow their example! Bicycle parking and removal Image from Bryony Rijks To avoid having your bicycle removed in the city, it is advisable to only park your bike at designated racks or a dedicated parking garage ( stalling ). Some locations allow you to leave your bike for up to two weeks, and some for up to six weeks. Read the City of Amsterdam's bicycle parking guidelines for further information or view the parking locations on a map . If a bike is found or removed due to illegal parking, it will be delivered to the Fietsdepot who can then use the engraving to inform legal owners that their bike has been found or recovered. If you have lost your (engraved) bike, you can contact the Fietsdepot to check if it has been recovered by calling 14020 during office hours. If they have it, you need to pay a fee of \u20ac25\u00a0to reclaim your bike, or approximately \u20ac40 to have it delivered to your home. You will need to show identification and have the key to the bike lock in your possession. Check the Fietsdepot website for more information.

These car parks are located on the outskirts of the city near motorways and have excellent public transport connections. Leave your car at one of the P+R Amsterdam locations and get right into the centre of Amsterdam in no time with public transport. Visit Amsterdam city centre using Park and Ride Parking in a Park and Ride (P+R) car park costs only \u20ac6 or \u20ac13 per 24 hours \u2013 with a maximum parking time of up to 96 hours (subject to exceptions). This is tremendous value for visitors to Amsterdam who will be travelling into the city centre zone . The P+R rates are calculated as follows: Off-peak rate: \u20ac6 per day. Valid Monday to Friday after 10:00 and all day in the weekend and on public holidays. Peak rate: \u20ac13 per day. Applies Monday to Friday for arrivals before 10:00. You can park for a maximum of 4 days. At P+R RAI you can park for a maximum of 24 hours. Condition of P+R: onward travel to city centre zone by public transport To be eligible for the discounted P+R parking rate: You must travel into the city centre zone using your OV-chipkaart or P+R GVB card(s) (which must be purchased within one hour of parking ). Upon return, the P+R payment machines check whether your last check-in on your return journey took place in the city centre zone. You will only be entitled to the discounted P+R parking rate if this is the case . If your last check-in was at a public transport stop outside the city centre zone, then you will not be entitled to the discounted rate and you must pay the regular parking rate. This ranges from \u20ac1.40 to \u20ac5.00 per hour. Before departing, you must pay your P+R fee within one hour of checking out of public transport . Please note: the discounted P+R parking rate does not apply to onward journeys by other means of transport (taxi, bike, walking etc.). For up-to-date parking space availability at all P+R locations in Amsterdam, please click here . Discounted public transport chip cards are available for purchase Park and Ride users must continue their journey into the city centre zone of Amsterdam. You can do so by using your own OV-chipkaart ( public transport chip card ). However, it is also possible to purchase discounted P+R GVB cards from the blue ticket machine at each site (you require 1 card per person and can purchase up to 5 cards per car*). The P+R GVB transport cards can only be used for travel on GVB bus, trams or metro services. Price of P+R GVB cards: 1 person: \u20ac6.00 2 persons: \u20ac6.00 3 persons: \u20ac7.00 4 persons: \u20ac8.50 5 persons: \u20ac9.50 * If you are travelling with more people, you can purchase additional public transport tickets at any GVB point of sale. Please note : after entering the P+R facility, you have one hour to purchase your P+R GVB cards . Each P+R GVB card is then valid for one hour of travel into the city centre and one hour of travel back to your P+R location (including transfers if required). When returning to the P+R location, you must pay your P+R fee within one hour of checking out of public transport .

How to use Amsterdam's Park and Ride (P+R) If you're new to P+R in Amsterdam, simply follow the steps below to park your car and enjoy all that the city centre has to offer . Upon arrival at the P+R, collect a car park ticket as you enter the P+R location. Do not use your credit card at the entrance , as it does not provide the P+R discount. Some P+R locations (such as at the RAI) now scan your car\u2019s registration number upon arrival instead of providing paper tickets. If you require public transport tickets, go to the blue ticket machine to purchase P+R GVB card(s) \u2013 these must be purchased within one hour of parking . Follow signs to the nearest public transport connection and check in at the transport stop or vehicle by holding your card next to the electronic card reader. Don't forget to check out when exiting the vehicle or transport stop . When visiting the city, be sure not to lose your P+R GVB card or P+R ticket, as you will no longer be entitled to a discount and will have to pay the normal parking fee. Please note: the P+R chip card is only valid for travelling to and from the P+R location (one hour each way) and not for continuous use in the city centre. In addition, P+R GVB cards are not valid on special night buses, on trains or on Connexxion or Arriva bus services. However, travellers using their private OV-chipkaart can also travel via NS trains and Connexxion bus services.

This easy itinerary is a worthwhile plan for when you end up in this part of town after dark. Culture World-class curation at Framer Framed Image from Framer Framed \/ Eva Broekema Curators and artists collide at this long-standing project space and arts foundation in the cultural epicentre of Amsterdam Oost. Every year, the venue collaborates with emerging and established international talents to organise exhibitions and an extensive public programme of lectures, debates, screenings and performances. You'll be confronted with work at the cutting edge of contemporary art, visual culture and politics from a diverse range of voices and perspectives in society. Pre-drinks Beers and sunshine at De Groene Olifant \/ Brouwerij \u2018t IJ Image from Sophie Image from Koen Smilde Photography Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 On the corner of Plantagebuurt and Oost, you\u2019ll find De Groene Olifant , a cosy local pub nestled between the zoo and leafy Plantage streets. With its living-room style d\u00e9cor, board games and laid-back crowd, it\u2019s a favourite neighbourhood hangout where you can stop for a coffee, craft beer, or a homemade snack. On sunny evenings, the terrace is a gem \u2013 perfect for watching the world go by before you begin your night. Plus, it\u2019s not far from Brouwerij \u2018t IJ, if you want more beers (and snacks) before a proper meal. Food Communal eats at Dapper Caf\u00e9 \/ Eatmosfera Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 Your next stop is food and you have tons of options, though there are a few notable crowd-pleasers for a group. First up is Dapper Caf\u00e9, located just around the corner from De Groene Olifant and Brouwerij \u2018t IJ. The newest venture on the Dappermarkt, this is a queer-run venue with a vegetarian-focused menu, home to the city\u2019s crispiest potatoes. Perhaps the biggest pull, however, is its location, with a terrace that catches the sun almost all day long, making it an ideal spot to transition from dinner into cocktails. Alternatively, head to arguably the city\u2019s best pizzeria at Eatmosfera, where you\u2019ll be wined and dined with oaky Tuscan whites and an excellent Stracciatella pizza. Cocktails Views and global flavours at Canvas \/ Catua Bar Image from Volkshotel Head to the roof of the Volkshotel for some of the city\u2019s most sumptuous views and cocktails at Canvas . The enclosed rooftop terrace is on the seventh floor and has a fantastic all-around view of the Amstel and the city centre. Hungry folks should head there during the weekdays for lunch, dinner, and bites. For something more lowkey, Catua Bar is just around the corner; a place for cocktails from Brazil to South Africa, though classics like the house-batch Negroni never go amiss. Music Balkan sounds at Kalemegdan Most people look for rock and jazz when it comes to live music, but Kalemegdan provides something different. A Balkan music bar, you\u2019ll be blessed with the many genres of this southeastern European area and beyond, from Yugoslavian rock and pop to Argentinian jazz. Dig into \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i (grilled sausages considered to be Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s national dish) while the sounds of the Balkans swell around you \u2013 there\u2019s no place quite like it. Clubbing Bunker atmosphere at Levenslang \/ Doka Image from Charlotte van de Gaag Image from Volkshotel Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 If you\u2019ve ever wondered what partying in a prison is like, head to Levenslang and you\u2019ll find out. Housed in the boiler room of former Bijlmerbajes prison at the southernmost edge of\u00a0Oost,\u00a0 this concrete corner is a fully fledged techno paradise, with all-nighters hosting some of the biggest local and international DJs around. Otherwise, for a convenient option after cocktails at Canvas, Doka is a subterranean listening bar in the basement of Volkshotel with an exceptional audio setup and such good sound insulation you\u2019d never know it was there. Late-night food Herby kebabs at Tarbush There aren\u2019t a ton of late-night eats this side of town, but Tarbush is a trusted stop for those looking for a midnight kebab. You\u2019ll find it on one of Ooost\u2019s major arteries \u2013 the Javastraat \u2013 where lemon and herby chicken and kebab meats are stuffed into foot-long d\u00fcr\u00fcms, a perfect antidote for a long and hopefully successful night out in Oost.

Together Again at Last . This exhibition was realised in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which is home to two key works from the series: Joseph Roulin and La Berceuse . Other loans from the series are from museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum , the Stedelijk Museum , Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and Museum Folkwang in Essen. Featuring more than twenty loans from prominent international collections, the exhibition offers a rare opportunity to see this series of iconic portraits together. A special friendship When Van Gogh arrived in Arles in 1888, he had difficulty finding common ground with the local residents, but he found a kindred spirit in Joseph Roulin. The postman, with his striking beard and blue uniform, became a favourite model and Van Gogh\u2019s best friend in the southern French town. Van Gogh painted not only Joseph, but also his wife Augustine and their three children: the seventeen-year-old Armand, the eleven-year-old Camille, and baby Marcelle. When Van Gogh suffered a severe mental crisis at the end of 1888, Joseph Roulin offered Vincent his unwavering support. He visited the artist at the hospital every day, and faithfully kept Vincent\u2019s brother Theo updated in a series of letters, which are now being exhibited together for the first time. Together with the portraits, these letters offer a unique reflection on this remarkable friendship. The modern portrait The portraits that Van Gogh made of the family reflect his deepest artistic ambitions. He wanted to capture more than just a physical likeness. Following the artistic example of his predecessors Rembrandt and Frans Hals, he tried to penetrate the soul of his models \u2013 an ambition that coincided with his personal search for connection in a period of increasing loneliness and mental health problems. Context The exhibition places the Roulin portraits in a broader art historical context by also showing work by Frans Hals, Rembrandt and Adriaen van Ostade \u2013 artists who Vincent meticulously studied. Work by Paul Gauguin is also on display. During his time at the Yellow House in Arles, the French artist also portrayed several members of the Roulin family. The photographs of the Roulin family members taken between 1902 and 1955 are a remarkable inclusion in the exhibition, revealing how Joseph, Augustine, Armand, Camille and Marcelle Roulin looked in later life. On the second floor of the exhibition, visitors head through a life-sized replica of the Yellow House to enter Van Gogh\u2019s studio, where he painted the Roulins. Old photographs of Arles complete the experience. The exhibition will first be on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (30 March to 7 September 2025) before travelling to the Van\u00a0Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026).

Snert It\u2019s green. It\u2019s more delicious than it looks. It\u2019s snert . Often, you\u2019ll see it called erwtensoep or Hollandse erwtensoep but it all means the same. Snert is emblematic of Dutch winter cuisine, and it\u2019s the ultimate winter warmer: a thick pea soup packed with onions, celery, leeks, carrots and sliced rookworst (smoked sausage), traditionally served with rye bread and smoky bacon. Stop by some of Amsterdam's best Dutch food restaurants to try it. Fondue Image from Proeflokaal van Wees It may not have its origins in the Netherlands, but fondue has a special place in the hearts of all Dutchies. Few things are cosier than huddling around a cauldron of hot melted cheese with a bottle of red on a winter\u2019s night, which is why the Swiss staple has become a mainstay in the Lowlands. There are plenty of places in Amsterdam to get your fondue fix, and we've even put together a selection of the very best fondues to make life easier and, dare we say, cheesier. Stamppot Stamppot is a big lovely mess of mashed potato mushed up with other vegetables, including sauerkraut, kale, spinach or turnip greens. Sometimes the potato is smashed with carrots and turnips, and then it\u2019s called hutspot . You\u2019ll typically find it served with a generously portioned rookworst (smoked sausage) or a pork chop at one of these traditional Dutch restaurants . Suddervlees Image from Moeders Looks aren't everything. Suddervlees literally means \"braised meat\" which translates on the plate to a big hearty beef and ale stew. It makes absolutely no attempt to look attractive (see picture), but with its punchy combo of slow cooked meat, beer, onions and seasoning, it\u2019s winter on a plate for many people in the Netherlands. Get it with frites to mop up all that lovely gravy at one of these traditional Dutch restaurants . Oliebollen Image from Koen Smilde Photography Oliebollen (which translates to \"oily balls\" \u2013 yum?) are so special that you can only get them for a few short winter months. Traditionally eaten on New Year\u2019s Eve, they\u2019re deep-fried dough balls dusted with powdered sugar and studded with raisins and currants. Look out for the oliebollenkramen (stalls), which appear around Amsterdam in mid-October, and eat as many as possible before they disappear for another year. These are our picks of the best places to find them. Poffertjes Repeat slowly: \"Poff-fert-jus.\" Now that you know how to say it, you have no excuse for not ordering trays and trays of these tiny pancake treats while you\u2019re in Amsterdam. Get them steaming hot from a street vendor, slathered in melty butter and powdered sugar, and devour them whole. Here's our round-up of the best poffertjes spots to treat yourself on a cold winter's day. Pannenkoeken Image from The Pancake Bakery Nice things about eating massive pannenkoeken (pancakes) in winter: everything. Thankfully, pancakes are as ubiquitous as bicycles in Amsterdam, so drizzle them in syrup and sugar and let the good times roll. Take a look at some of our favourite pancake houses if you need inspiration. Chocoladeletters and pepernoten Image from Amie Galbraith Go into any food store in November or early December (pre-Sinterklaas), and you will probably see many giant letters made from chocolate. These chocoladeletters are an integral Sinterklaas tradition in the Netherlands, given as gifts to reflect the first letter of the recipient\u2019s name. It\u2019s also absolutely fine to buy them for yourself. Likewise, you'll see the supermarket shelves stacked high with pepernoten ( speculaas- spiced mini biscuits), which are eaten by thousands of spectators as Sinterklaas makes his customary under-the-radar arrival into the city, with a massive canal parade known as the Sinterklaas Intocht . Chocomel Image from Koen Smilde Wrapping your hands around a mug of hot chocolate milk on a winter\u2019s day is one of life\u2019s simple pleasures. You\u2019ll find hot chocolate (usually found on menus under 'Chocomel') at most cafes and street markets in Amsterdam - ask for yours with a splash of rum if you want to feel a bit adventurous. These are our favourite spots for an indulgent cup . Appeltaart Holland\u2019s national pastry comes into its own in the winter months, and there\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than sitting on a heated terrace on a crisp winter\u2019s day, tucking into a thick slice of freshly baked apple pie. Appeltaart (Dutch apple pie) is a thing of wonder: with layers of sliced apple tightly packed under a layer of yummy doughy pastry. A couple of cafes are often said to have the best appeltaart in Amsterdam, but there can be only one winner \u2013 so make up your own mind with this list of the best appeltaart in Amsterdam.

Image from Pavlovs Safety, health and crime in Amsterdam: who do I contact? Updated 16 October 2025 at 16:14 Planning a trip to Amsterdam? Knowing who to contact in emergencies is essential for a safe and worry-free visit. This guide covers health services, emergency contacts, police support, and safety tips for navigating the city, from medical care to handling lost belongings. Stay prepared and enjoy Amsterdam with peace of mind. Keep these crucial numbers handy for any situation. Safety disclaimer and advice during Amsterdam Dance Event Image from mikebreeuwer.com We want you to have a fantastic time at ADE \u2014 but safety first. Know that the (mis)use of drugs is illegal, and there are real health risks involved. Stay hydrated, eat well, and avoid mixing substances. Through ADE's \u201c Celebrate Safe \u201d campaign, venues will have enhanced security, medical aid stations, and staff on hand to provide assistance. For your journey home (or between events), services like Diva Ride (female-driver option) are available to offer an inclusive ride. Take care of yourself and those around you. If anything feels wrong, physically or in your surroundings, don\u2019t wait: get help immediately. Know your limits and respect those of others. Medical assistance Image from Shuttershock Emergencies (112) In life-threatening situations, call the emergency helpline by dialling 112. An ambulance, fire department or police will be dispatched to help you. This is a Europe-wide emergency helpline (equivalent to 911 in the United States or 999 in the United Kingdom). In addition to Dutch, operators speak English and can offer services in French or German. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you can send an equivalent text to 0800 8112. For emergency visits to your hotel room, telephone consultations and consultations on location, contact the hotel reception or call the tourist doctor at +31 (0)20 427 5011. Fees are determined by the National GP Association and are covered by most travel and medical insurance. Hospitals and ER The accident and emergency ( spoedeisende hulp or more commonly A&E) department of a hospital is meant for life-threatening situations requiring immediate specialist medical treatment. In all non-life-threatening situations, first, contact your GP. They will determine if you need treatment in A&E and inform you which hospital or location to visit. General health For less serious issues \u2013 such as minor falls, forgotten medication or unexpected\/recurring minor conditions \u2013 you can contact TouristDoc on +31 202 624 282. TouristDoc's medical professionals provide comprehensive in-room medical care for Amsterdam's visitors who want to bypass the inconvenience of hospital visits. For information on fees, visit the website. Amsterdam's 24-hour dental clinic, Dental 365 , treats patients experiencing chronic pain and other dental emergencies on a walk-in basis. The practice is open from 8:00 until 23:00, and a dentist is on call 24\/7 for emergencies after these hours. Police Image from Bas Uterwijk Reporting a crime If you have been a victim of harassment, intimidation, violence, robbery, or any other type of crime during your visit to Amsterdam, it is really important to report this. Either report the crime online or in person at a police station in the city (by appointment). The Dutch police website offers a search tool for police station locations. In emergency situations or to report a crime in progress, call 112. For non-emergency situations requiring police assistance or to make an appointment to report a crime in person, call 0900-8844 (if using a mobile phone with an international SIM card please dial +31 343 578 844). Hate crimes Amsterdam is for everybody, regardless of race, religion, gender identification, political beliefs or sexual preference. Visitors and residents are free to be who they want to be, and have their views and choices respected. Hate crimes against members of any community or minority will never, ever be tolerated. If you\u2019re a member of the LGBTQI+ community, read this guide to safety and resources in Amsterdam for more advice. Lost and found If your passport has been stolen, report this to the police . If you have lost your keys, wallet or other personal possessions, or you have found somebody else's lost belongings, the iLost website should be your first stop. Remember that it usually takes three business days for an object to be registered online. Dropped something valuable in the canal? If your bike, valuables, keys, or phone fall into the canal, don't fear! Mark the location and call Recovery Divers , who will come to the rescue (for a fee) with their scuba diving gear, metal detectors, and pinpointers to fish it out. Usually, they can help you the same day or the next day, depending on availability and what kind of item you lost. They dive in water such as ponds, canals, rivers, and lakes throughout the Netherlands. Enforcement officials Municipal enforcement officials ( handhavers ) are a familiar sight in Amsterdam, particularly in busy public spaces, train stations, and public transport. Representing the City of Amsterdam, they ensure safety and security on the streets. Easily recognisable in blue uniforms with \"Handhaving\" on the back and a reflective chequered strip on the chest, they are approachable and ready to assist locals and tourists with directions or municipal queries. Their daily tasks include addressing car parking issues, illegal waste dumping, nuisance behaviour, and improper bike\/scooter parking. They can request identification, issue fines or warnings for minor offences, and notify the police or other authorities in unsafe or illegal situations, allowing the police to focus on serious crimes. Pickpockets As in all major cities, pickpockets can be active in crowded places like caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, and major events in Amsterdam. Keep a close eye on your belongings, especially valuables like smartphones. If possible, store them in a hotel safe or station locker and carry minimal cash. Report any pickpocketing to the police. Be cautious of distractions, such as someone pushing, touching, or asking for directions. Pickpockets often work in teams, using signals to coordinate. If a stranger engages you, it could be a distraction for theft. To prevent mobile phone theft, note your phone's IMEI number and report thefts immediately so the police can add it to a national stolen phone database. Install a 'find my phone' app to help trace its location. Traffic and road safety Image from Koen Smilde Photography Driving and sleeping in vehicles Amsterdam's narrow streets and canals are not ideal for cars, especially in busy districts with many pedestrians and cyclists. Use parking garages or park-and-ride facilities outside the city centre, which have excellent public transport links. Read this guide to driving in Amsterdam . Sleeping in vehicles is prohibited in Amsterdam for safety reasons, with fines of \u20ac140 for violations. Cycling and walking Amsterdam residents own about 850,000 bicycles and cycle two million kilometres daily. The city continues to improve bike paths and parking facilities to maintain its status as a bike-friendly city. Read our complete guide to safety and cycling in Amsterdam . In Amsterdam\u2019s city centre, narrow streets and pavements often tempt pedestrians onto public roads, cycle lanes and tramways, but this is dangerous. Stay on pavements, give space to wheelchair users, and check for bikes and traffic before crossing streets. Remember, traffic in the Netherlands drives on the right. Check out our video about walking in Amsterdam . Be careful near the canals While picturesque, canals can be dangerous. Falling into the water is risky due to high walls and cold temperatures. Always stay aware of your surroundings near the water. Public urinals are available, as urinating in canals is illegal. If you fall in: Shout for help, hold onto something, and wait for assistance. If someone else falls in: Call 112, notify them, and provide a flotation aid if possible. Use ropes or sticks to pull them to safety and seek help from bystanders.

From 15 October 2025 up to and including 25 January 2026, 'Michelangelo and Men' is on display: an exhibition about the fascination of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) with the male body. An international first: never before has an exhibition been entirely dedicated to this theme. More than twenty drawings from the collection of Teylers Museum will be supplemented with top-class international loans, including the marble sculpture 'Apollo-David'. All these works combined shed new light on the glorious leading role the male body played in both the life and art of Michelangelo. Naked and muscular Michelangelo was fascinated by the male body. Featuring in nearly all his artworks, he often portrayed it naked, muscular, and in provocative poses. His David and The Creation of Adam are artworks that are so deeply embedded in our collective memory that we often take them for granted. In Michelangelo's own time, however, these works were revolutionary, and over the course of history they were frequently considered controversial. Multiple perspectives Michelangelo and Men examines the male body in Michelangelo\u2019s work and life from all angles: from the outside influences of his predecessors and classical antiquity, to his own extensive anatomic knowledge and use of male models. Also highlighted is the theoretical and religious significance of the male body to Michelangelo, as well as his presumed personal predilection for men. In the exhibition a number of contemporary voices furthermore reflect on how Michelangelo represented the male figure: from queer to Roman Catholic, and from feminist to personal trainer. In this way the exhibition also addresses timeless themes like gender, sexuality, and beauty ideals.

It's the most frequently asked question at the museum. And now it's finally here. In the colorful exhibition \"At Home in the 17th Century,\" you'll experience daily life 400 years ago up close. Full of surprising stories and unique objects. As a visitor, you'll walk through a full day in the 17th century via nine life-size viewing boxes. Exhibition At home is the 17th century Dates Fri 19 Dec 09:00 - 17:00 Sat 20 Dec 09:00 - 17:00 Sun 21 Dec 09:00 - 17:00 More dates Location Rijksmuseum , Museumstraat 1 , 1071 XX Amsterdam Show in Google Maps Contact +31206747000 info@rijksmuseum.nl visit website Get tickets from \u20ac25 Full of contrast From large families to singles, from rich to poor, from migrants to merchants, Protestants, Jews, and Catholics: the 17th century was both vibrant and diverse. People lived in homes as diverse as their lives. Through everyday experiences, you'll discover all facets of society at the time. So much to discover Earthenware cooking pots and brooms are juxtaposed with the mantelpiece Philip Vingboons designed for Amsterdam mayor Joan Huydecoper and a unique silk bodice, a masterpiece from the V&A Museum in London. The exhibition centers on the famous dollhouses of Petronella Oortman and Petronella Dunois, highlights of the Rijksmuseum's collection. From rage ball to silver From early morning to late evening. You'll experience a day in a 17th-century household. You'll wander through rooms filled with objects, from mopheads to silverware, and discover that every object tells something about who the people were and how they lived. They, too, struggled with balancing work and family, had sex, and mourned family. On the other hand, they often made very different choices than we do today. Think of health, interior design, or the division of labor at home. You'll realize how close and yet so far away the 17th century is. The cardboard world of Steef de Jong Theatre maker and visual artist Steef de Jong is the exhibition's designer and, just like in his performances, uses cardboard as his primary material. He has created nine viewing boxes that transport you to various domestic activities at different times of the day. Dollhouse by Petronella Oortman The centerpiece of the exhibition is the dollhouse of Petronella Oortman, a very wealthy woman. The dollhouse is one of the Rijksmuseum's most prized pieces and has been fully digitized for the first time. An online special, to be released in October, will allow you to wander through the miniature rooms of the dollhouse.

She\u2019s since embedded herself into the pop-sphere, as much for her sound as her outward queer lyricism and appeal. Catch her at Melkweg as he debuts her latest album, a cathartic body of work that captures what it means to begin again. 16 December | doors open 19:00 | Melkweg | tickets here SOHN If you like: Jamie Woon, L\u00e5psley The musical moniker of Christopher Michael Taylor, SOHN, mixes downtempo beats with soulful vocals that have earned him a reputation as a go-to for moody, ambient electronica. He\u2019ll be bringing some winter cool to Bitterzoet\u2019s stage, a perfect choice for those looking for a bit of introspection and songs that linger. 13 December | doors open 19:30 | Bitterzoet | tickets here Flyte If you like: Laura Marling, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez The indie folk project of English duo Will Taylor and Nick Hill, Flyte\u2019s warm, guitar-led melodies have led them to the summit of folk and collaborations with some of the genre\u2019s top artists, from The Staves to Laura Marling. Lush harmonies and introspective lyrics combine for what\u2019s always an intimate gig. 11 December | doors open 19:30 | Melkweg Oz | tickets here Julia Wolf If you like: Halsey, kiiara Sexy, sultry pop with sucker punch production, Julia Wolf expertly blends side-eye lyricism with TikTok-ready sounds that look back to the grungy early 2000s. One for the pop heads that like a little sadness. 11 December | doors open 20:00 | Melkweg Up | tickets here Ball Park Music If you like: Vance Joy, Boy & Bear Brisbane-hailing five-piece Ball Park Music have been making music for years now, with eight albums of critically acclaimed indie pop under their belt.

Here are just a few reasons why Amsterdam is the perfect winter destination. Amsterdam looks like a fairy tale in the snow Image from Marie Charlotte Peze\u0301 There are no two ways about it; Amsterdam is stunning in white. Impossibly pretty at the worst of times, the city looks like a Christmas card when it\u2019s dusted in snowflakes \u2013 making for a wildly romantic backdrop to any visit. For optimum snowman conditions, head to one of the larger parks like\u00a0Vondelpark, Amsterdamse Bos\u00a0or\u00a0Westerpark,\u00a0where you\u2019ll find vast expanses of uninterrupted white stuff just waiting to be packed into snowballs. And don't miss the chance to head into the surrounding region for some the best winter day trips in the Amsterdam Area . The city becomes a spectacle of light Image from Koen Smilde Transforming Amsterdam into a vast outdoor art gallery during the darkest winter months, the annual\u00a0Amsterdam Light Festival sees magical light installations adorn canals, streets and landmarks from December to January. And, of course, you can always rely on a grand department store to bring the festive atmosphere and theatrical window displays. De Bijenkorf on Dam Square hosts a special ceremony in mid-November every year to switch on the thousands of (energy-efficient) twinkling lights that decorate its building. Crowds gather to admire the spectacle, which includes performances, a fireworks display and a late-night shopping event. Here's a roundup of the best places to see the holiday lights . You can (sometimes) ice-skate on the frozen canals Image from Koen Smilde It doesn\u2019t happen often, but if conditions are correct (and generally, the temperature needs to dip below four degrees for four consecutive nights), then canals are blocked off to allow enough ice to form. Et voila;\u00a0the world\u2019s most beautiful ice rink. But even if the canals don\u2019t freeze over this year, there are plenty of other opportunities for outdoor ice skating in Amsterdam \u2013 including the spectacular Winterparadijs ice fair and the Jaap Eden ice rink. Everything is gezellig Image from Patrick Schneider Dark nights, twinkling fairy lights, playing board games in cosy pubs\u2026 everything about winter in Amsterdam is genuinely gezellig . Pronounced \u2018he-zell-ick\u2019, \u00a0this word with no literal English translation is at the heart of Dutch culture, encompassing everything from \u2018cosy\u2019 and \u2018quaint\u2019 to \u2018friendly\u2019 and \u2018relaxing\u2019. It can be applied to any situation or thing that makes you feel warm and fuzzy, and you\u2019ll hear it a lot if you visit Amsterdam in winter. Check out these roundups of brown bars , board game cafes and cosy neighbourhood bars for your gezelligheid induction. Amsterdam\u2019s winter markets are amazing Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam does an excellent line in festive fairs; taking a more independent, unique approach than many other European cities. Every weekend through November and December, you\u2019ll find a different market popping up somewhere in or around the city, ranging from the traditional to the trendy, selling beautiful produce and lovingly prepared food and drink in unique locations. They\u2019re the perfect place to find art, jewellery, artisanal food products, locally designed homeware and handcrafted decorations. Shopping is usually accompanied by a soundtrack of carol singers and festive entertainment. Find out more about Amsterdam\u2019s Christmas markets . It's a perfect Valentine's retreat Image from Jan de Ridder Amsterdam is consistently voted amongst the most romantic cities in the world, so what better destination for a loved-up Valentine's break? From romantic candle-lit restaurants and lavish hotel rooms to old-school cinema or remarkable cultural itineraries, find out more about what to do with your partner in Amsterdam on Valentine's Day . Always keep an eye on our weekend guide and cultural agenda for the best tips - from pop-up dining to cocktail masterclasses, film festivals, theatre, gigs and more to treat your partner. You can eat to your heart\u2019s content Hearty, substantial and satisfying, Dutch cuisine was made for cold days and nights. From stamppot (traditional Dutch mash) to snert (thick pea and ham soup) and everything in between, Dutch food is designed to warm you up from the inside out. Get inspired with these warming winter dishes to try , cosy spots for comfort food , and the most beloved neighbourhood cafes to warm up in. It's oliebollen season If there\u2019s one reason to visit Amsterdam in the winter, then oliebollen is it. These delicious balls of doughnutty goodness come out once a year, so you must eat as many as possible while you have the chance. Get them steaming hot and dusted in sugar from a street vendor, and then get some more. Need inspiration? Check out our article on the best places for oliebollen . The museums are less crowded Image from John Lewis Marshall Amsterdam is less crowded in winter, meaning shorter queues at the major museums . Save the winter months for exploring the Rembrandt House Museum, Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk , where you can shelter from the cold and then pile into a cosy brown bar afterwards. For a glimpse into Amsterdam\u2019s past winters, look no further than the 17th-century masterpieces on display in the Rijks. Dutch landscape artists such as Hendrick Avercamp, Adam van Breen and Jan van Goyen painted emotive scenes of entire communities wrapped up warm and enjoying ice-skating, sledging, socialising and even ice fishing. Sinterklaas is coming to town Image from Amie Galbraith Unlike in other parts of the world where Father Christmas only appears after children have gone to bed, the Dutch Father Christmas is not shy of the limelight. In fact, he likes to make quite the spectacular entrance, sailing into town every winter on a kilometre-long parade of floats and boats, welcomed by upwards of 400,000 spectators. The annual Sinterklaas parade takes place in mid-November, with the feast of St Nicholas itself falling on December 5. Find out everything you need to know about the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition .

Here are a few tips for how to do as the locals do in Amsterdam along with some further insights into what makes life special in the Dutch capital. Don\u2019t get stuck in one neighbourhood Image from Koen Smilde Photography With all the museums , theatres , wonky pubs and staggeringly gorgeous canals, most first time visitors are so taken by the city centre that they don\u2019t leave the canal ring - we don't blame you! But when you\u2019ve had enough of all those incessantly ringing church bells, do as the locals do and hop around the many different neighbourhoods of Amsterdam. For hidden coffee spots, alternative gig venues and trendy boutiques head to Oud-West . Take the free ferry to NDSM for industrial-chic dining, impressive street art and vintage shopping. Or explore the bustling street markets, lively cafe terraces and hottest new restaurants in De Pijp . These neighbourhood guides are packed full of recommendations for cultural hotspots, walking tours, family-friendly things to do, hidden gems or simply where to find the best sandwich. Go off-grid Image from Jan de Ridder Amsterdammers love a good party, and you\u2019ll find plenty of live music venues and clubs to dance your troubles away in. Some of the best underground music happens in the city\u2019s lesser-known venues or as part of major festivals like Amsterdam Dance Event . When it comes to other cultural events , you\u2019ll find so much to explore beyond the mainstream. The city boasts a wealth of independent boutique cinemas and unusual museums , whilst our lovingly curated Weekend Guide will keep you in the know of the best off-grid happenings. Shop at local markets Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam's bustling street markets are a great place to get a sense of how locals shop and the diverse range of produce and cuisines available in the Netherlands. Our firm favourites are the Ten Katemarkt in Oud-West and Dappermarkt in Oost , packed with vendors selling flowers, fish, cheeses, fabric, fruit and veg. You\u2019ll also find a range of food trucks serving up typical Dutch snacks and deep-fried delicacies. If you haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to sample kibbeling (battered cod bites served with herby mayo), loempia (Indonesian spring roll) or a broodje haring (a raw herring sandwich), the city's street markets are the place to start! Only eat fried snacks for dinner Image from Alex Cheuk The vrijmibo (Friday afternoon drinking session) is a well-loved pastime in Amsterdam and involves heading to a bruin cafe ( brown bar ) with friends or colleagues to indulge in beers and snacks - the more deep-fried, the better. Delicacies like bitterballen (crispy meatballs served with mustard) or borrelnootjes (deep-fried nuts - yes, you read that correctly) are designed to hold off hunger just enough to keep the conversation going until closing time. If you\u2019re still peckish, you can always stop by a FEBO vending machine for a nutritious frikandel (fried sausage) to eat on the walk home - lekker! Here's a round-up\u00a0of Dutch foods to try in Amsterdam for some further explanation of the fried food phenomenon. Try not to get distracted by dogs on bicycles Image from Pema Prima If you\u2019re feeling confident enough to brave the cycle paths, a bike rental is a superb way to get across the city. You\u2019ll witness some exceptionally cute things: dogs feeling the wind in their fur or five toddlers piled into a bakfiets . Try not to get distracted, as these are extremely normal occurrences. Other eyebrow-raising sights include Amsterdammers peddling with no hands, singing as they cycle or balancing absurdly bulky objects - a standing lamp, a surfboard, a flatscreen TV - on their handlebars. We don\u2019t recommend attempting any of the above (except maybe the singing thing, because the world needs more of that). Fancy venturing further afield, here's a great selection of cycle routes that head out of the city in the gorgeous wilds of the Amsterdam Area . Give the language a go Image from Marie-Charlotte Pez\u00e9 With those tough g \u2019s and haunting vowel sounds, Dutch has a bad rep for being one of the harder languages to get your tongue around. In reality, there are many aspects of learning Dutch that make it surprisingly easy for English-speakers. Many words are very recognisable: koffie , bier , museum , appeltaart , hotel - to name a few. Not to mention that Dutch speakers tend to use leuk (nice), lekker (tasty) and gezellig (cosy) to describe almost every situation. Honestly, if you can manage those three adjectives, combined with super (really) or niet (not), then you\u2019re halfway fluent. Strive to achieve gezelligheid Image from Amie Galbraith So there\u2019s this word, gezellig , which is a fundamental part of Dutch national identity - perhaps even more so than stroopwafels . Loosely translated it means \u2018a warm atmosphere\u2019, \u2018cosy\u2019, \u2018pleasant\u2019 or \u2018togetherness\u2019 and can be used to describe either a setting or a person. Amsterdammers take a lot of pride in gezelligheid and to truly experience the city like a local, you\u2019ll need to plan your activities with this concept in mind. Keep everything relaxed and sociable and surround yourself with people that make you feel good. You might while away the afternoon people watching from an authentic brown bar or take the time to catch up with an old friend over brunch . Ask yourself at all times: how can I make this situation more pleasant and comfortable? That picnic in the park can always be improved by extra cushions or additional snacks, for instance. Take holidays seriously as the Dutch do Image from Amie Galbraith If you\u2019re lucky enough to visit Amsterdam on a national holiday, getting into the festive mood will be a requirement. On April 27, every street, park, balcony and canal will be awash with orange-clad revellers for King\u2019s Day and participation will be near impossible to avoid. On New Year\u2019s Eve , many locals will call upon their nearest friend with a terrace to watch the fireworks whilst gorging on oliebollen and champagne. And it\u2019s always worth remembering that Sinterklaas on December 5 is not simply \u2018Dutch Christmas\u2019. Sint\u2019s annual arrival in the city is a hotly anticipated event with a unique set of customs surrounding it, not to mention excessive gift-giving that is taken very seriously . Read up on all these major events and celebrations before your trip and get swept up into the party spirit. Congratulate everyone at a birthday party Image from Winnie Verswijvel Birthdays are equally important in the Netherlands. Many Dutch homes feature a calendar of upcoming birthdays in the toilet to ensure that none slide past uncelebrated (don\u2019t even try it, you won\u2019t get away with it). For the uninitiated, birthday parties themselves can be slightly odd affairs. Rather than saying \u2018happy birthday\u2019, the traditional greeting is gefeliciteerd (congratulations) which you must say to everybody in attendance - not just to the birthday boy or girl. The birthday cake tradition still stands, but you will have to buy your own if it\u2019s your special day. This guide to the best cake shops in Amsterdam has got you covered. Arrive at a bar, on a boat Image from Ode aan de Amstel You\u2019ve probably already noticed that Amsterdam has quite a few canals. But did you know that in many places, you can rock up to a waterfront bar, on a boat . Whilst many locals have their own or share one between friends, there are plenty of locations across the city where you can rent a boat yourself. At some bars you might not even have to disembark to order your food and drinks - how convenient is that?

Learn more about the I amsterdam City Card Try herring from a herring cart Image from Koen Smilde Raw herring may sound a little scary to the uninitiated, but every visitor to Amsterdam should give it a go. You\u2019ll spot haringhandels (herring carts) serving up this Dutch speciality all over the city - ask for a broodje haring to get the fish served in a small sandwich with pickles and onions. The best time to try raw herring is between May and July, when it is said to be at its sweetest. Still hungry? See if you can taste your way through all of these traditional Dutch snacks during your visit. See windmills, countryside and beaches Image from Dmitry Rukhlenko If you\u2019re in town for more than a few days, then plan a day trip to the Amsterdam Area to explore the diverse attractions of the surrounding area. Just a short hop from Amsterdam lies a rich landscape of gorgeous countryside, beaches, windmills and historic forts \u2013 all easily reachable from the city centre. Just 20 minutes from Amsterdam Central by train, the picturesque city of Haarlem overflows with history and culture, plus a great selection of shops, cafes and restaurants. And if lying on a beach is more your thing, then the beautiful golden stretches at Amsterdam Beach will be happy to oblige with golden sands, dunes and plenty of watersports. Looking for picture-perfect views of windmills, rolling grassland and winding canals? Set your sights on Old Holland , a pastoral paradise that\u2019s so photogenic it is basically why Instagram was invented. If you have time for just one destination, grab the I amsterdam City Card and head to the iconic windmill-filled village of Zaanse Schans . Your visit to the iconic Zaanse Schans windmills is included in the I amsterdam City Card. Learn more about the I amsterdam City Card Immerse yourself in culture at Westergas Image from Koen Smilde Located at Westerpark , this sprawling complex of former industrial buildings used to be the city\u2019s municipal gasworks.

You can get free entry to these museums, as well as over 70 others with the I amsterdam City Card .\u00a0Recently renovated to a world-class standard, the leafy and architecturally astounding 19th-century district of Oud-Zuid is an art lover\u2019s utopia. The open square between the buildings pulses with activity all day, with open-air exhibitions, markets and a large paddling pool to dip your toes into on warmer days. Discover hidden cultural gems in the canal ring Image from Kees Hageman Alongside the staggering Museumplein, you'll find plenty more cultural adventures hidden around other pockets of the city centre. Head to the Waterlooplein area for the Rembrandt House Museum - the only place wholly dedicated to the world-renowned Dutch master and the fascinating Jewish Cultural Quarter , encompassing the Jewish Museum, National Holocaust Museum, and Portuguese Synagogue.

Read this guide to art and culture in the city centre for more. Cruise past canal houses and bridges Image from Stromma Created in the 17th century to keep the sea at bay, Amsterdam\u2019s UNESCO-protected canal belt is the quintessential postcard-perfect vision of Amsterdam. It is an unbelievably pretty sight, especially after sundown when the bridges are lit up by fairy lights, and the whole area has a magical feel. Floating along the canals by guided boat tour is a great way to get under the city's fabric, and you\u2019ll learn lots of fascinating facts along the way \u2013 such as why the tilting homes along the canals are known as \u2018dancing houses\u2019. There is a Canal Cruise Ticket for every type of cruise, from hop-on-hop-off sightseeing tours to atmospheric candlelit nighttime cruises with food and wine. Try local beer at a historic brewery Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam has eight remaining windmills, and the easiest to visit is De Gooyer\u00a0in the Oostelijke Eilanden (Eastern Islands) neighbourhood. And this isn\u2019t just any windmill \u2013 for under the sails of this striking landmark is Brouwerij \u2018t IJ , an award-winning artisan microbrewery with a large outdoor drinking terrace and 30-minute guided tasting tours. The brewery produces a range of organic standard and seasonal ales that you'll find in many Amsterdam bars, though nothing tastes quite as good as beer brewed on the premises. Just try to pace yourself because the city is brimming with craft beer bars and microbreweries that will beckon you for one more frothy fluitje .\u00a0Read our guide to the best breweries in Amsterdam for more. Catch the free ferry to Amsterdam Noord\u2019s renovated shipyard Image from Joris Raaijman Many visitors to Amsterdam never manage to venture north of Amsterdam Central Station, which is a shame, considering the vibrant food, drink and cultural scene that\u2019s burgeoned across the water. A short (free) ferry trip will take you to several drop-off points, including cultural hotspot NDSM , where you can enjoy a host of hip waterside hangouts and frequent festivals and events. Or sail directly across to Noord , one of the city's hippest neighbourhoods - home to top restaurants, nightlife and mesmerising new art spaces. Go to a concert or show at a world-famous venue Image from Jan de Ridder Whether you like listening to live music in a majestic concert hall or an intimate dive bar, Amsterdam has you covered in high style. Housed in a converted church, Paradiso has hosted iconic acts like The Rolling Stones and Prince and continues to showcase a superb roster of international talent. An impressive grand dame, Concertgebouw is lauded for its excellent acoustics and lineup of world-class orchestras alongside various famous musicians. While Boom Chicago is one of the best stages for comedy, improv and spoken word , and has been tickling the ribs of audiences for over 25 years, all performed in English. Drink in a bird's-eye view of Amsterdam from a rooftop bar Image from Koen Smilde Toast to Amsterdam\u2019s impressive architecture and stunning skyline with cocktails at one of the city\u2019s stylish rooftop bars . Soak in the sprawling vista while you take a dip in one of the alfresco jacuzzis at Canvas , Volkshotel\u2019s terrace bar that\u2019s known for its affordable drinks and priceless view of Amsterdam. Or swing on over to A\u2019DAM Tower for sundowners at Madam. You\u2019ll feel like you are on top of the world. Live like Dutch royalty Image from Ben van Melzen Photography There are many castles, palaces and fortresses in the Amsterdam Area that provide a window into the region\u2019s regal past and will make you feel like the star of your own fairytale. The Royal Palace Amsterdam is King Willem-Alexander\u2019s official reception palace where world leaders and heads of state are hosted and entertained, but it is also open to visitors much of the year. Just 15 kilometres southeast of the city, you\u2019ll find Muiderslot \u2014a 13th-century castle that looks like it could have been plucked from a Disney movie with its five towers, moat and drawbridge. Search for unusual finds at Europe's biggest flea market Image from Nichon Gerlum If you love bargain-hunting, quirky curiosities and sprawling industrial warehouses, make time for a visit to IJ-Hallen , one of the best markets on the continent. Take the ferry from the harbour behind Central Station to the NDSM -yard, and from there, it's just a five-minute walk to the market. Step into the cavernous space or browse the many stands that spill out onto the wharf to rifle through a wild collection of records, vintage clothing, home furnishings and antiques. If you can\u2019t find something special here, you aren\u2019t looking hard enough.\u00a0Read our guide to the best vintage shops for more thrifting ideas. See how Anne Frank lived Image from Cris Toala Olivares Reflect on the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during World War II at the Prinsengracht house, where diarist Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis for two years after fleeing persecution in Germany. The front of the Anne Frank House is now a thought-provoking museum, but the back annexe has been preserved to give an idea of what life was like for Anne and the families she hid with. Waiting times are often lengthy, so visit early in the morning or book online in advance to beat the queues. Eat pancakes and feed goats in the Central Park of Amsterdam Image from Edwin van Eis Amsterdamse Bos , on the southern edge of the city, is almost three times the size of New York\u2019s Central Park. This lush urban oasis provides ample opportunities for bike rides, picnics, swimming, strolling over hills and flower-blanketed valleys, or just barbecuing with friends. In the forest, you\u2019ll find Goat Farm Ridammerhoeve , where you can meet goats, lambs, chickens, pigs, cows and horses and then fuel up at its charming restaurant that serves delicious goat cheese. And for anyone hoping to get closer to nature, you'll find plenty more urban farms and sustainable initiatives dotted around the city. Experience culture, film and architecture across the IJ Image from Ruben Hanssen Dominating the view from the southern banks of the IJ behind Central Station, the striking white EYE building has rapidly become one of Amsterdam\u2019s most iconic landmarks since it opened in Spring 2012. An absolute must for film fans, the EYE Filmmuseum houses a permanent exhibition space that showcases retrospectives and contemporary exhibits, as well as a vast film library, cinema and fabulous restaurant bar with a terrace overlooking the water. Catch the free \u2019Buiksloterweg\u2019 ferry from behind Central Station, which takes three minutes. Discover Amsterdam's independent shopping streets Image from Merijn Roubroeks While many visitors head straight to the busy chain stores on Kalverstraat, those in the know get their retail therapy at one of the city's more locally flavoured shopping paradise . The most well-known of these is De Negen Straatjes or \u2018The Nine Streets\u2019 at a quaint warren of cobbled streets that connect the main canals between Leidsegracht and Raadhuisstraat. Here, you\u2019ll find over 200 retailers, including a fine selection of independent boutiques , vintage shops and speciality stores selling everything from designer dresses to handmade cosmetics . If you\u2019re looking for souvenirs to take home, skip the tourist traps and shop for authentic Dutch design and quality Amsterdam brands at the Makers Market in De Hallen or the I amsterdam Store at Central Station. Eat your way around food stalls in a former tram depot Image from Bowie Verschuuren Located in the hip Oud-West neighbourhood, De Hallen is a hotspot for arts, crafts, fashion and food in a recently refurbished industrial building dating from 1902. De Hallen houses a cinema, independent stores and a boutique hotel, as well as the impressive Food Hallen where visitors can munch their way through a selection of upmarket street fare from one of many vendors located around a central bar. Every other weekend, a fortnightly local goods market sets up stalls in the building\u2019s main passageway. Wake up and smell the tulips Image from Tom Elst Yes, they\u2019re as clich\u00e9d as clogs, but tulips are a definitive symbol of Dutch culture, and a trip to the Netherlands wouldn\u2019t be complete without feasting your eyes on these beautiful blooms. If you\u2019re visiting Amsterdam in spring, then take the short 20-minute trip out to the world-famous tulip fields ( Bollenstreek ) \u2013 stretching out in colourful stripes across miles of lowland fields between Haarlem and Leiden. There are also ample opportunities to stop and smell the tulips right in the heart of the city; the bulbs spill out of bouquets at the Bloemenmarkt, line the windows of the Tulip Museum (included in the City Card ) and seem to burst forth from every possible planter during the Tulip Festival, which lasts all of April.

Sex and drugs in Amsterdam: what are the rules? Updated 27 February 2025 at 13:34 Read Amsterdam\u2019s rules around sex and drugs to ensure a safe and respectful visit. From cannabis policies and coffeeshop etiquette to laws on hard drugs, alcohol, and public behaviour, this guide covers everything you need to know. Learn about the Red Light District, tips for staying safe, and navigating Amsterdam\u2019s unique culture while abiding by local laws. Cannabis Image from Koen Smilde Regarding soft drugs such as cannabis, a tolerance policy (\"gedoogbeleid\") is applied in the Netherlands. This policy means that although the possession and buying of soft drugs are recognised as a violation of the law, you will not be prosecuted if it concerns a maximum amount of five grams of cannabis. Please note: From 2023, it's illegal for both visitors and Amsterdam residents to use soft drugs in the old city centre (Red Light District, Nieuwmarkt and Dam Square). These areas are marked with signs saying \u2018No smoking cannabis in public\u2019. Officers and enforcers can issue possible fines of \u20ac100. Amsterdam coffeeshops Tourists are allowed to buy cannabis in coffeeshops in Amsterdam. To enter, you must be 18 \u2013 your ID will be checked. Only purchase from reputable coffeeshops (never from street dealers) and start with a small amount if you are not experienced with cannabis. Never mix soft drug use with alcohol. Visitors should keep in mind that most venues other than coffeeshops do not allow soft drugs to be consumed on their premises. In other words, you can't smoke cannabis in most clubs or bars, even in smoking areas. Despite the accessibility of weed in Amsterdam, not everyone is a smoker. Always consider the people around you. Alcohol Image from Caf\u00e9 Maxwell The consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the majority of public places (especially in the city centre), but you are naturally welcome to visit one of Amsterdam\u2019s many bars. Never combine drugs with alcohol. Public nuisance Remember that Amsterdammers live in every neighbourhood, including the Red Light District, Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein. Limit noise and drunkenness, clean up your trash and don't pee in the canals. Return plastic bottles and cans to supermarkets for a deposit. Please be aware of the local laws and the on-the-spot fines for unacceptable behaviour: \u20ac150 for noise pollution \u20ac150 for littering \u20ac150 for public urination \u20ac100 for public intoxication Hard drugs Image from Darryl Adelaar As in the rest of the world, the use and distribution of hard drugs like cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy in Amsterdam is strictly illegal. Possession, dealing, selling, production and most other acts involving any drug is punishable by law. Bringing drugs into a club, bar or festival is prohibited. Visitors are strongly advised to prioritize their well-being. If you do choose to use drugs, be aware of the risks. Avoid street dealers Visitors are strongly advised to ignore street dealers, who often sell fake or unsafe drugs. Street dealers may attempt to sell dangerous substances to unsuspecting tourists in popular areas. It is crucial for visitors to understand that buying or using hard drugs not only exposes them to severe legal consequences but also poses significant risks to their health and safety. The quality and purity of substances purchased from street dealers are highly questionable, posing serious health risks such as overdoses, poisoning, or adverse reactions. Medical assistance after drug and alcohol use For severe drug-related emergencies, seek immediate medical assistance . If someone is not feeling well, don't hesitate to ask for help or call medical services at 112. In the Netherlands, you cannot be prosecuted for offences related to taking drugs after visiting the emergency department. Jellinek is a leading addiction prevention and treatment centre in the Netherlands. They specialise in providing evidence-based care for a wide range of addictions, including alcohol, drugs, and gambling. Read their advice online for visitors to Amsterdam. Sex workers and the Red Light District Image from Ferenc Horvath Window brothels, sex clubs and escort agencies can operate legally if the City of Amsterdam has granted them the relevant permits. Everyone is welcome to visit the Red Light District, although if touring the area, be respectful and don\u2019t take photographs or record videos. If you decide to visit a sex worker, practise safe sex and never deal with sex workers under 21 years of age. Forced sex work is an extremely serious crime. Remain vigilant to indications of forced sex work (such as anxiety, bruises or willingness to have intercourse without a condom) and report any suspicions to the police by calling 0900-8844 \/+31 343 578 844 or anonymously on 0800-7000 (from a Dutch phone). Official guided tours of the Red Light District are not allowed. During weekends, bars and other catering establishments in the Red Light District must close at 2:00. Access to these entertainment venues is only possible one hour before closing time. The cobbled streets of the Red Light District (De Wallen) are packed with quirky shops, museums, lively pubs and fantastic restaurants. Read on for more things to do in the Red Light District .

Explore the spacious streets for trendy bars, rooftop views, diverse stores, buzzing street markets and a totally different perspective on Amsterdam. Explore a 17th-century estate Image from Jan de Ridder Situated in the stunning Park Frankendael , Amsterdam's only surviving 17th-century country estate transports you back to an era of 17th-century grandeur. Wander through Huize Frankendael 's sprawling gardens, filled with manicured hedges, sculptures and water features. The stately home hosts exhibitions and special events throughout the year, and Restaurant Merkelbach , located in the former coach house, is an ideal spot for lunch. Check out the local brewing scene Image from amsterdam&partners With breweries around every corner and under every windmill, Amsterdam Oost is something of a Walhalla for craft beer lovers. Let's take Brouwerij \u2019t IJ to start with, which was an independent local microbrewery long before anyone dreamed up the modern terminology. Housed in a former bathhouse next to a proper Dutch windmill, the bar boasts a large enclosed terrace that stays busy in all weathers. Next up, the tasting room at Poesiat & Kater offers speciality brews with a side of history, including the resurrected legendary Van Vollenhoven beer. Or, for some fragrant grapefruit and lychee undertones to your beverage, sample classic concoctions from the heated terrace of De Eeuwige Jeugd . Sip jenever surrounded by gorgeous views Image from Koen Smilde Photography Image from Albert Brunsting Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 Located in a former pumping station, the tranquil terrace of Distillery \u2018t Nieuwe Diep is almost entirely surrounded by water. Soak up the beautiful views over the lake as you sip on the best jenevers and liqueurs from the tasting room. This hidden hotspot is parked right in the middle of Flevopark , a tranquil escape packed with walking routes and gorgeous green barbecue areas. It\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the Joodse Begraafplaats Zeeburg, a Jewish cemetery that is now heritage-listed. Take a walk at Oosterpark Image from Jan de Ridder Oosterpark is a fantastic green space filled with ponds, streams, a wading pool for children and plenty of walking paths. In the summer months, the lawns will be awash with sunbathers and picnickers from diverse walks of life and the park also hosts a variety of festivals. Sit back overlooking the pond to try and catch a glimpse of the park\u2019s nesting birds or pass by the Speaker\u2019s Stone on a Sunday afternoon to hear the locals saying what\u2019s on their mind. Play boules in a hidden garden Image from TK Photography Amsterdam Oost is awash with fantastic bar terraces for people-watching, but only one has a secret jeu-de-boules pitch. De Vergulden Eenhoorn (The Gilded Unicorn) is a historic pub and farm founded in 1702, serving up tasty seasonal lunch and dinner dishes such as Moroccan Taktouka with asparagus, egg and chorizo or Indonesian gado-gado salad with sesame chicken and cashew nuts.

The Dappermarkt on Dapperstraat is a great place to pick up everything from fresh produce to beautiful fabric. You\u2019ll also often find good meat or cheese and the occasional sushi wrap. As with all street markets, the goods on offer and crowd sizes vary significantly daily; the best way to find out is to head there. Some fish vendors here are an excellent opportunity to sample traditional Dutch delicacies like kibbeling , herring or eel. Check out a festival Image from Jan de Ridder Oosterpark is home to a busy schedule of events, and some great festivals. The Keti Koti Festival (Surinamese for broken chains) celebrates the abolition of slavery with a busy, colourful festival complete with performers and a parade.

Discover the up-and-coming food scene Image from Bar Botanique Oost is a beautifully diverse neighbourhood, and a trip there wouldn\u2019t be complete without a meal at one of the many local favourites. The green Bar Botanique on Swindenstraat is here for you if you\u2019re in a French-Mediterranean mood. Finally, for all-day dining and bar food, try turbo or De Tros , or Badhuis on the Javaplein.

Shop and eat your way along Javastraat Image from Koen Smilde Gentrification has well and truly set in, yet this street named after one of the Netherlands\u2019 former spice islands remains a compelling melting pot, where Moroccan butchers and Surinamese roti shops sit next to trendy concept stores, stylish (coffee) boutiques and edgy streetwear specialists.

This season\u2019s newest eateries take heart in the cold, as cosy bistros, Georgian fare and bakeries stave off the winter chill. CENTRUM Editor\u2019s Pick: Sering Centraal Best for: community eats One of the best parts of winter is the community it fosters - after all, the cold brings people together like few things can. And a lot of that coming together is around the dining table. De Sering, which has run a community space and kitchen out near Sloterdijk, is making its central debut with a new outpost at Mediamatic in what\u2019s set to be the centre\u2019s newest communal hub. The menu is entirely vegan and the focus is really on fostering community with free meals for Stadspas holders to a donation-based dinner for all. Lunch is Mon-Fri and priced at \u20ac7.50, with a choice of two soups and two mains, best enjoyed with Sering Centraal\u2019s waterside views. And only a 10-minute walk from Central Station, this could well be the centre\u2019s best value and beautiful spot. Sering Centraal | open Mon-Fri | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Dijksgracht 6 Amra Best for: indulgence Nothing says comfort food quite like bread and cheese. And Amra, which just opened in the Jordaan, brings the rich and indulgent dishes of Georgian cuisine to this corner of Amsterdam. Dumplings, orange wine and khachapuri (bread boats filled with molten chees, butter and an egg yolk) are a surefire way to warm you up and satisfy whatever wintry cravings might have taken hold. Amra | open Tue-Sun, 17:00-22:00 | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Eerste Anjeliersdwarsstraat 6 Little Bonfire Best for: Retro snugness Gather round the fire at this snug haunt near the Bloemenmarkt. Self-described as Amsterdam\u2019s downtown living room, there\u2019s a hint of Mad Men here with its plush interior, rich mahogany panelling and leather bar seating. Comfort food lines the menu here as dishes like pan-fried sea bass, mushroom bourguigno and flat-iron chicken star. There\u2019s also a roster of selected wines and classic cocktails which make it easy to while away an afternoon and an evening snug under the warm lighting. Little Bonfire | open all week, times vary | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Keizersgracht 449 OOST Hagen Oost Best for: Scandi-chic coffee An espresso bar by way of Copenhagen, this coffee spot in Watergraafsmeer stands out \u2013 and not just because of its forest-green coloured exterior. The setting is pretty grand \u2013 all geometric-patterned flooring, bare brick walls and a long, floral-printed coffee counter \u2013 but don\u2019t be discouraged, it\u2019s just (good) coffee after all. Grab yourself an espresso, inspired by the serene coffee tasting Copenhagen does so well; a maximal experience dressed up in minimalism. Hagen Oost | open all week, 07:30-18:00 on weekdays, 08:30-18:00 on weekends | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Mideenweg 59 Caf\u00e9 Bica Best for: whitewashed escapism Should you be looking to cling to summer or draw it closer already, Caf\u00e9 Bica can help. Situated along the Amstel River, just along from the owner's other venture Bam Boa, this sunlit space is perfect for those blue-skied winter days. A white-washed interior is simple but keeps the light filtered through, and the coffee and freshly baked pastries help keep you there. Stylish and undoubtedly a spot that\u2019ll draw even the most reluctant De Pijp folk across the river, Bica looks to prove that the Wessperzijde really is the Amsterdam Riviera. Caf\u00e9 Bica | open daily 08:00 - 18:00 | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Weesperzijde 44 NOORD Camarat Best for: candle-lit wine Low-lit and luxurious, Camarat is a winter spot if ever there was one. Along the ever-happening Gedempt Hamerkanaal and right next to Amsterdam\u2019s urban winery Chateau, the geometric shelves lit up by candles and floor-to-ceiling windows combine an indoor and outdoor feel. Yet even with the light, Camarat feels intimate; perhaps it\u2019s the rich, brown textiles and furniture that does it, or the menu which spans wild duck and delicate skate (fish). Either way, come here for the kind of hushed nights winters are made for. Camarat | open Wed-Sun, opening times vary | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Gedempt Hamerkanaal 4 Barossa Best for: bistro classics Cosy bistro fare almost never goes amiss, and add in a waterside view and you've got a perfect spot. That's Barossa, the latest spot to open in NDSM, channelling chic modernity in decor with comforting, seasonal fare on the menu. Run by the chef behind Peruvian fusion restaurant Nazka, it's no frills food here; from Caesar salads to market fish, roasted poussin and greens, plus bavette with peppercorn sauce. It's all prepared with panache from the open kitchen, and with a well-sourced wine menu and a special burger Friday deal, you'll find both class and comfort. Barossa | open Tue - Sat: 6pm - 10pm | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Werfkade 39 WEST The Jollof Club Best for: flavour and comfort A staple of West African cuisine, jollof rice arrives in the neighbourhood in the form of Jollof Club. Named after the region\u2019s most well-known dish, Jollof Club is a celebration of West African, serving up smoked jollof rice alongside other specials like soya chicken and rice pancakes drizzled in Scotchh Bonnet sauce. A delicious and savoury culinary experience, Jollof Club marks another chapter in De Baarsje\u2019s expansive food journey. The Jollof Club | Open Wed\u2013Sun, Sun Lunch only | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Hoofdweg 141 Cheeky Best for: anytime coffee The appeal\u2019s in the name at this brand new coffee spot in Westerpark. You'll find good brews, good tunes and good atmosphere here in this cosy space that's as much about the music as it is the coffee. Keep an eye out for special pop-ups and collaborations, which they do throughout the season and has included thai burgers and ADE dj specials. Either way, it\u2019s a spot to hide from the cold and get communal in. Cheeky | open Tue-Fri 08:00-16:00, Sa-Su 08:00-16:30 | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Fannius scholtenstraat 26H ZUID Sol Coffee Bar Best for: living room feels Everywhere wants to be a living room of Amsterdam but few actually succeed in balancing that low-key, relaxed almost effortless look-and-feel with the well-oiled machine of a good establishment. Sol makes a very respectable go at being a place that will stick around \u2013 a brocante-style space that pairs comfy seating, coffee and plenty of light to good effect. You won\u2019t have to look far for home comforts here - the speculoos bun will do that if the apple and caramel pie hasn\u2019t provided that already. There\u2019s a warmth here that\u2019ll keep you going through the season, and a no laptop policy means yes, chatting to other locals is encouraged. Sol | open Wed-Sun, 09:00-18:00 | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Tweede Sweelinckstraat 6 Gorgo Lunchroom Best for: Anatolian goodness Born out of the homeland of its founders and the notion of in betweens, Gorgo Lunchroom is a celebration of modern-day Anatolia. Taking inspiration from the range of cultures that call contemporary Turkey home, Gorgo Lunchroom has a little bit of everything. Coffee, fermented drinks and sandwiches, but it\u2019s the specific flavours on show that make it interesting. Like tahin and honey, which in their words, is \u201ca gooey cheese melt of ka\u015far and Welsh cheddar, topped with tahini, honey, preserved unripe green figs, and roasted hazelnuts\u201d, orkavurmal\u0131 : slow-roasted beef, sal\u00e7a, fresh thyme, ka\u015far and pecorino. Oh and the cookies are good too. Gorgo Lunchroom | open Tue-Sun, 08:30-17:00 | price range \u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac | Staringplein 22 In case you missed it Boon & de Koot Cosy, bistro feels by the creators of De Zoldering and Lof wine bar, this one\u2019s for the Dutch and French food lovers and anyone who just wants comforting dishes and wine. Boon & de Koot | open Thurs-Mon, | price range \u20ac\u20ac-\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac | Barentszstraat 171-173 Follow our social media channels Stay up to date on events and happenings in Amsterdam, get inspiration for things to do and discover hidden gems on our dedicated @Iamsterdam Instagram and @Iamsterdam_official TikTok channel.

This month, wander through botanical gardens, take in light sculptures across the city, celebrate the season with a visit to the Christmas Circus and much more. Editor\u2019s Pick: Hortus Winteravonden Image from Jan Jaap Hubeek Best for: plant lovers This winter, it\u2019s time to get cosy at one of the world\u2019s oldest botanical gardens, as the doors remain open until late for Hortus Winteravonden (Winter Evenings). Venture through the beautifully lit greenhouses \u2013 and the new Climate Greenhouse, which spans three climates around the world \u2013 as you discover ancient palms and tropical plants. Cuddle up by the campfire with a hot chocolate on the winter terrace and experience exclusive exhibitions featuring night-blooming flowers and much more. Hortus Winteravonden | 27-30 December & 2-3 January | Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam Light Festival Image from Janus van den Eijnden Best for: night owls The city\u2019s annual light festival returns, this time under the theme of \u2018Legacy\u2019 and how we want to be remembered. To glimpse all the installations looking to capture what that means, you have a range of options. Opt for a cocktail cruise with one of the many canal companies or follow a self-guided 6.5km walking route that you can dip into at your own pace. Bring your winter coat, camera and a sense of awe. Amsterdam Light Festival | Until 18 January 2026 | city-wide The Nutcracker and the Mouse King at National Opera & Ballet Best for: festive nostalgia One of the season\u2019s most celebrated shows returns to the National Opera & Ballet stage for a festive run. The Nutcracker and the Mouse King \u2013 a tale of an inanimate Nutcracker coming to life to fend off the evil Mouse King \u2013\u00a0takes ballet form this time as snow-flecked dancers in frosted attire glide across the winter stage. Choreographed and designed by Toer van Schayk, he was inspired by the drawings of artist Christiaan Andriessen (1777-1854), which provided a window into an Amsterdam of old. The Nutcracker and the Mouse King | 12 December 2025 \u2013 2 January 2026 | National Opera & Ballet Derek Mitchell\u2019s Double Dutch: Two at Meervaart Best for: searing cultural commentary Nobody gets the Dutch and the Americans (and even the Brits) better than Derek Mitchell. He\u2019s best known for his live shows blending standup with cultural commentary, which are a tongue-in-cheek ode to his adopted homeland. Catch him at the Meervaart Theatre for his Double Dutch Two show, for searing comedy on what it means to be caught between cultures. Double Dutch | 8 December 2025 | Meervaart Theatre Surinamese Art in Transition at Museum Cobra Best for: inquisitive artists This past November marked 50 years of Surinamese independence. And Museum Cobra is commemorating that milestone with a special exhibition dedicated entirely to Surinamese Art. Around 24 artists and one collective will present their works on what Surinamese freedom means, depicting its past struggle, present change and future, with fashion, photography, paintings, installations, film, and performance art all on show.

When it's all too much fun, head into the Winter Cinema for nostalgic festive classics. Winterparadijs | 17 December - 3 January | RAI World Christmas Circus at Carr\u00e9 Image from Koninklijk Theater Carr\u00e9 Best for: family outings For decades, the World Christmas Circus at Royal Theater Carr\u00e9 has been one of the most popular family outings during the festive period. Marvel at the flying trapeze artists, star clowns, enchanting costumes, horse whisperers, and daredevils as award-winning acts from the most prominent circus festivals worldwide join forces in one spectacular show for this 39th edition. World Christmas Circus | 17 December 2025 - 4 January 2026 | Carr\u00e9 Queer Christmas Market at Door Open Space Best for: non-traditionalists Christmas markets are everywhere in and around Amsterdam, but why not break with convention and tradition this year and head to the Queer Christmas Market? Meet 35+ queer entrepreneurs selling a range of vintage, art, food and drinks, with drag performances on show too. This is a chance to support queer makers, sort out your seasonal gifting and indulge in the festive spirit \u2013 plus the market donates \u20ac0.50 per ticket to a queer charity so there\u2019s a good cause to support too. Queer Christmas Market | 13 December, 11:00-17:00 | Door Open Space Vivian Ammerlaan at Singer Laren Image from Vivian Ammerlaan Best for: intrepid travellers Get swept up in the dreamy, storm-coloured images of Vivian Ammerlaan whose photography of the Rocky Mountains is almost as good as visiting the region yourself. Inspired by her travels among the ridges, Amerlaan\u2019s shots are haunting, spectral and effortlessly wintry. Bookend your trip with a visit to the on-site caf\u00e9 for a cosy winter afternoon. Vivian Ammerlaan | until 18 January 2026 | Singer Laren Amsterdam, almost demolished at Grachtenmuseum Best for: urban history The Museum of Canals (Grachtenmuseum) is one of the city\u2019s unsung heroes and its latest exhibition is proof of more quiet heroism. In Amsterdam, almost demolished, the tale of how the city maintained its historic architecture and centre in the face of a mass modernisation push takes centre stage. A tapestry of protest footage, maps and photography, the exhibition traces the people who helped preserve Amsterdam\u2019s beauty \u2013 and it\u2019s future.

Follow the top 5 tips below to skip the ticket booth queues, avoid the biggest crowds and experience some of the city's highlights! Always plan and pre-book Image from Koen Smilde It\u2019s great to wander around Amsterdam and enjoy whatever awaits you. But if you have the luxury of pre-booking tickets for museums and attractions , the most significant benefit is showing up when it suits you and avoiding the lines at the ticket booths (just be careful to follow the signs to the correct door).

Time is on your side Image from Mirte Vreemann Image from Christian van der Kooy Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 3 Slide 1 of 3 Remember that many museums in Amsterdam don't just stick to the nine-to-five routine! Here's our guide to art after dark: late opening museums in Amsterdam . The Van Gogh Museum is open every Friday evening until 21:00. Why not book your timeslot around 17:00 on a Friday? The museum is quieter as crowds disperse for dinner, allowing more personal and precious moments to enjoy the artworks. The Rijksmuseum (free with the I amsterdam City Card ) notes that April, May and August are the busiest months and that Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the most popular days. As such, waiting times can be around 30 minutes. But if you\u2019d really like a bit more space to enjoy the museum, their advice is to either arrive in time for opening (9:00) or at the end of the afternoon (after 15:00). There\u2019s always great demand to experience the famous canal-side Anne Frank House . Throughout the year it\u2019s common to see queues stretching around the block, often with waiting times of 45 minutes (up to 2 hours at peak times). The advice from the Anne Frank House is to purchase your ticket in advance, but it\u2019s also well worth stopping by for an evening visit \u2013 from April until August, the museum is open until 22:00. The Stedelijk Museum is open till 21:00 on Fridays, and the photography museum Foam is open till 21:00 on Thursdays and Fridays. Always check the websites of your favourite museums for extra opening hours and special events. See the city by bike Image from Robin Utrecht Taking to two wheels and having the city pass you by feels especially \u2018Amsterdam\u2019.

Take a paddle board along the River Amstel, relax by the water in Flevopark or test your balance with an adventure sport like windsurfing or rock climbing. Here\u2019s our roundup of the best spots to get active and outdoors in Oost. Oosterpark Image from Jan de Ridder Image from Jan de Ridder Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 From cultural festivals such as Keti Koti\u00a0to picnic opportunities overlooking the water, Oosterpark offers something for everyone. Perhaps one of the city\u2019s most stunning parks, this beautiful green space has a paddling pool for children to splash in, plenty of areas for sporty activities (like rollerblading and jogging) and various outdoor sculptures to admire. There\u2019s even a bandstand where dance classes take place, and it is one of the few parks in Amsterdam where you can still barbecue, making it an excellent option for warm summer evenings. Park Frankendael Image from Merijn Roubroeks In the 17th and 18th centuries, dozens of imposing summer residences owned by wealthy Amsterdammers lined the streets of Amsterdam Oost. Today, only Huize Frankendael remains. The large garden around Huize Frankendael was partly opened up as a pleasure garden in the 19th century and was later used as a city nursery. Today Park Frankendael is a popular neighbourhood hangout and the art and culture garden of Oost. Within the park, you\u2019ll find Restaurant De Kas situated within a giant greenhouse which sources ingredients from its very own kitchen garden. Flevopark Image from Koen Smilde Surrounded by vast swathes of water, the unique location of Flevopark makes it the ideal location to spot wildlife and lesser-seen plant species. Strolling through this lush green area, you\u2019ll see sights you don't often encounter in Amsterdam, including rare birds like the kingfisher who lives by the lake near Distillerij 't Nieuwe Diep . It's the ideal spot for dog-walking, picnicking and sunbathing along with the trendy residents of Amsterdam Oost. Looking for even more adventure? Flevopark also boasts a delightful open-air swimming pool, Flevoparkbad , and the largest adventure playground in Amsterdam: Jeugdland . Along the Amstel Image from Koen Smilde Amsterdam-Oost is flanked by the broad Amstel River, which winds its way South into some spectacular green countryside. There\u2019s an excellent Amstel River cycle route which passes the ornamental gardens and allotments of Tuinpark Amstelglorie , then heads along the Duivendrecht polder in the direction of the historic village Ouderkerk aan de Amstel. The Amstel is also an excellent spot for rowing, boating or trying your hand at Supping and canoeing. Check out the rental centres at Kano & Sup Amsterdam and SUP rental . One of the numerous rowing clubs in Amsterdam is The Berlagebrug Rowing Center , directly on the River Amstel which offers classes, private lessons and tours. Surfcenter IJburg Image from Strand IJburg Within easy reach of the city centre and Amsterdam-Oost, IJburg is a watersports paradise. Surfcenter IJburg offers windsurf classes for all levels, including those who have never stepped onto a board and those who want to train to be an instructor. All equipment is provided, and Blijburg Beach, where the clubhouse is situated, is the perfect spot to hang loose and watch that glorious Dutch sunset. Ultimate frisbee Image from Husky - CC BY 4.0 Ultimate frisbee is one of the fastest-growing team sports in the world; a fun an accessible game where points are scored by throwing the frisbee to a team member in the end zone. Amsterdam is getting in on the fun, with more and more ultimate frisbee fans in town. Amsterdam Ultimate Club in Oost is one of the main clubs in town and their outdoor training sessions take place at Sportpark Drieburg. Of course, you can also read up on the rules online, grab a frisbee from a toy shop and head to the nearest park with a bunch of friends. Jaap Eden Ice Rink Image from Jaap Eden Baan The colossal Jaap Eden skating rink, open from October to March, is the go-to spot for amateurs and pros alike to develop their skills. Budding speedskaters can make use of the 400-metre track, which allows you to glide through quite a few laps in your own lane without having to swerve for children. But don\u2019t worry, if you haven\u2019t nailed your double axels yet, there\u2019s an indoor rink and a beginners corner. Jaap is the home turf of the Amstel Tijgers, so be sure to check the schedule for ice hockey matches, discos and a variety of other public activities. De Vergulden Eenhoorn Image from Vergulden Eenhoorn If you\u2019re looking for more gentle exercise, perhaps the kind you can do with a glass of wine in hand, look no further than De Vergulden Eenhoorn . This historic country pub conceals one of Amsterdam\u2019s best-kept secrets: its very own jeu de boules pitch. If a quick round of petanque is still too much exertion for you, why not lounge around in the deckchairs of the beautiful secluded garden as drinks and snacks are brought to you?

In this culturally diverse district, you\u2019ll find all manner of exciting restaurants offering modern takes on various cuisines. There's also a wealth of breweries, cocktail bars, a fantastic range of coffee and brunch hotspots and some of the best falafel and roti in town. Coffee and lunch hotspots Image from Rum Baba Amsterdam Oost is a coffee-lover's paradise with what seems like a new espresso bar or caf\u00e9 to try every day: The beans are roasted on-site at Rum Baba, and you can taste the difference. 4850 is a fine-dining restaurant by night, serving buns and Scandinavian-roasted coffee for sipping on the terrace by day. Coffee Bru is the spot to grab a tasty filter coffee (roasted by Rum Baba), buttery scones or a slice of toasted banana bread. Also check out: The Cottage , tHUIS aan de AMSTEL or Bakhuys to get your caffeine fix. Bar Bachrach Image from Anouk Erisman Image from Tom Flanagan Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 Lovers of modern Middle Eastern food, look no further! Bar Bachrach, located on Javaplein, is heavily inspired by the cuisines of Lebanon, Tel Aviv, and Barcelona. Expect an elevated presentation and a well-varied menu filled with inventive takes, such as the liver pate challah toast with pear chutney, shish boreks with pine nuts and yoghurt, and much more. Highlights include smoky eggplant with pomegranate molasses, lamb kofta served with tahini and pickled vegetables, and their signature freekeh salad with herbs, nuts, and citrus dressing - each dish offering a bold, balanced mix of flavours that feel both comforting and fresh. Badhuis Image from WV Productions Every neighbourhood has a spot that everyone considers the spot. In the east of Amsterdam, that place was long considered the Badhuis , a former bathhouse on the Javaplein that functioned as a place for the predominantly working-class locals to wash, meet and get together. Now it's an all-day caf\u00e9 and brasserie, serving international fare for the community. The space is arguably the primary draw, but then so is the menu, from coffee and croissants in the morning and sandwiches in the day to classic bistro mains like mushroom ravioli and steak frites, all paired with wine, cocktails or a custom Badhuis beer. Brouwerij 't IJ Image from Koen Smilde This brewery bar under a windmill is a beer-drinking institution in Amsterdam. Brouwerij 't IJ was one of the city's first independent microbreweries, and you'll see locals proudly sporting t-shirts with their iconic ostrich logo all over town. The large enclosed terrace will be packed year-round with punters sampling classic brews like the IJwit, Flink Pale Ale and Natte Dubbel, along with new experimental creations freshly poured from the taps. You'll also find a great menu of Dutch and Belgian snacks such as ox-sausage, pickles and cheese boards to keep your stomach lined during a merry afternoon of beer tasting. Caf\u00e9 Wu Image from Jois Ang French and Chinese food may not be the most obvious pairing, but that's precisely what makes Caf\u00e9 Wu so inventive and enticing. Along the market street Dapperstraat, this bistro combines the best of Chinese food with the haute cuisine of French gastronomy. Here, you'll find a gorgeous open kitchen, a selection of wine bottles (over 170 to choose from), and a chef's and \u00e0 la carte menu filled with some of the prettiest plates of food you'll find in Oost. Cantonese roasted duck gets a facelift in a dish of duck breast, Russian cabbage and wrapped in puff pastry, while bone marrow serves as one of the bistro's flagship dishes, com boned with veal tongue, crispy onions, chilli oil and rice. And there's even entertainment after the food from 22:00, where vinyls help set a more ambient and intimate mood. Local Dealer Image from Local Dealer Image from Local Dealer Previous slide Next slide 1 \/ 2 Slide 1 of 2 One of Amsterdam's best hotspots for authentic Mexican street food , Local Dealer is a colourful diner on the Dappermarkt with a straight-to-the-point concept. Choose from a selection of ceviches, antojitos (little snacks) or\u00a0tacos loaded up with everything from carne asada (grilled steak) to barbacoa lamb or Holy Pastor (their delicious vegan option with grilled pineapple). Or drop by on a Sunday for their brunch event to munch on huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos and chilaquiles with a bloody mary in hand as DJs spin funky tunes. On warm evenings, mezcals, margaritas, micheladas and bottles of Modelo beer fly off the bar towards the lively outdoor terrace - we'd recommend reserving a spot if the sun is out. Ode aan de Amstel Image from Ode aan de Amstel Perched on the Amstel with a waterside patio and unparalleled river views, Ode aan de Amstel is a new all-day dining spot for unusual but delightful dishes with an Asian twist. Dive into scallops with passionfruit foam with a wakame and pak choi salad or hand-cut steak tartare with green curry cream and matchstick fries. The tandoori-rubbed chicken and prawn skewers served with sticky lemongrass rice cubes, garlicky yoghurt and ponzu dip are also not to be missed. Tip: pick a fair-weather day to visit, as the terrace here is terrific! Krux Brouwwerf Image from KRUX Brewed in the smallest vats in Amsterdam, Krux Brouwwerf' s beer goes straight to tap and into your glass. This small-scale set-up allows Krux to experiment with tastes: you will find fourteen beers on tap that change regularly. Relax in the spacious beer garden as you quench your thirst with a fresh pint of IPA or settle into Remy's Corner inside with a platter of bitterballen to share. turbo & Buurtcafe De Tros Image from Lotte Bergman Midcentury decor, ambient lighting, teak furniture, and a gourmet croquette are just some things you'll find at all-day caf\u00e9 turbo . The sister venture to Buurtcafe De Tros next door, turbo, is the more low-key sibling of the two, a place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in between.\u00a0As a result, the menu is far-reaching, with popular choices like steak tartare, tuna, and chicken legs, all made with seasonal ingredients. There are sandwiches for lunch, too, ranging from meatball subs to katsu fish sando. But the star dish is the broodje kroket , a Dutch classic given a new twist. An oxtail croquette topped with remoulade sauce on a brioche bun, this is arguably Amsterdam's most luxe take on an old favourite. Beyond the food, you'll find great coffee from Friedhats roastery in Amsterdam and an extensive wine list, too. Wilde Zwijnen Image from Wilde Zwijnen The chefs at Wilde Zwijnen have been giving authentic Dutch dishes a contemporary facelift for over a decade now. As much as possible, the kitchen sources high-quality seasonal products from small-scale farmers in the surrounding region. Delve into a three or four-course menu which encompasses a range of creative dishes - herring caviar, tomato granita, duck stew, razor shell clams and asparagus ice cream - which showcase the very best of modern Dutch cuisine. Each plate is thoughtfully composed, balancing rustic Dutch roots with refined technique and a touch of playful surprise. Counter On one of Oost\u2019s most vaunted (and once voted best) streets, you\u2019ll find Counter . A veggie-focused deli in the day and wine bar at night, it hits all the markers for an all-day neighbourhood spot at exceptionally good value. In the afternoon, you\u2019ll find a much sought-after but infrequently found lunch menu \u2013 a soup, sandwich and sweet all for \u20ac10. Come the evenings, it\u2019s all low lights, wine and the family meal \u2013 meaning a large portion of quality food like nasi and tempeh \u2013 for \u20ac12. You\u2019ll be hard pushed to find better value for money paired with quality and atmosphere \u2013 it\u2019s cosy and has a string-light lit terrace \u2013 and in 2025, that\u2019s exactly the kind of restaurant we need in Amsterdam.

Back Manchester named as one of the best places to visit in 2024 by The New York Times By Visit Manchester on Jan. 10, 2024 2 min read Manchester has been selected by The New York Times to feature in its annual \u201852 Places to Go\u2019 list for 2024 . The US publication\u2019s annual list of where to travel features Manchester as a \u2018music-mad city\u2019, selecting it at number 12 in the global destinations it recommends visiting in the year ahead . Major musical milestones for the city are cited, including the opening of Co-Op Live, which will be the UK\u2019s biggest music venue when it opens in April with a 23,500-capacity venue, and the Worldwide Music Expo (WOMEX), which will bring over 2,600 music professionals to the city in October. The article also mentions the reopening of Band on the Wall, Manchester\u2019s oldest music venue, and New Century, one of the latest new venues to open, as reasons for the city\u2019s inclusion in the prestigious list. The listing opens by stating: \u201cMusic has long been at the core of Manchester\u2019s gritty soul, from Joy Division and the Stone Roses to Oasis and, now, Harry Styles, who is backing Britain\u2019s largest new music arena, Co-op Live, set to open in April.\u201d Recent cultural investments in the city are mentioned, including Aviva Studios, which opened as the home of Factory International in October 2023, and large-scale events including Beyond The Music, which brings a four-day music festival and conference to the city\u2019s venues from 11-14 October 2024. Whilst already well-known for its rich music history and heritage, in recent years Greater Manchester has carved out a solid reputation as a place to enjoy live music. In addition to year-round gigs and performances at venues of all shape and size, Manchester\u2019s spring and summer months are packed with outdoor concert series and festivals held at the city\u2019s sporting stadiums, Castlefield Bowl, and Heaton and Wythenshawe Parks, then the city becomes a clubbing mecca throughout autumn and winter months at venues like Warehouse Project. The city\u2019s reputation for a wider genre of music has also strengthened in recent years \u2013 the beloved Hall\u00e9 Orchestra will this year welcome a new Principal Conductor and Artistic Director, Kahchun Wong, taking over from Sir Mark Elder who has led the orchestra for 24 years. In March, Manchester will host the Royal Philharmonic Society Awards \u2013 \u2018the biggest night in UK classical music\u2019 \u2013 for the first time outside of London. And it was announced in late 2023 that the English National Opera will relocate its main base from London to Manchester by 2029. Manchester\u2019s inclusion in the global list places it alongside destinations including Singapore, Paris, Brisbane, and Vienna, and is the only destination in England to be included in the list of 52 locations .

Manchester City stadium tour Read More Sport in Manchester Well-known for its world-famous football teams, Manchester has much more to offer in the sporting world. Starting with football, Manchester is home to two world-famous and iconic football teams; Manchester City and Manchester United. Though a local rivalry exists, the two teams have propelled Manchester onto the global stage in world football. Manchester United are at home in Old Trafford, the largest club football stadium in the UK, whilst Manchester City occupy the recently expanded Etihad Stadium, which was originally built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. With both clubs offering stadium and club tours, as well as unique match day experiences, a visit is a must for any sports fan visiting Manchester. As well as this, Manchester also has a number of lower league professional teams, including Rochdale, Oldham, Bolton, and Wigan. Emirates Old Trafford , home of Lancashire Cricket Club is a world-class sporting venue. With over 150 years of history the Club is one of the most sought-after venues for international cricket and has witnessed some of the sport\u2019s most iconic moments. Manchester has a huge influence over some of the UK\u2019s best known Olympians and Paralympians. Swimming and cycling world-champion Paralympian Dame Sarah Storey, Taekwondo stars Jade Jones and Lutalo Muhammed, cyling gold medallists Jason Kenny and Laura Trott, relay medallist Kelly Massey, and 2016 gold-medallist hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh MBE all either live or train in Manchester. Manchester is also the home to many other well-known sports teams. The Manchester Giants Basketball team reformed in 2011, and have reclaimed their place in the professional British Basketball League. Previously one of the largest clubs in UK basketball, Manchester Giants have rekindled the thriving amateur basketball scene in the region. Playing their home games at the Lucozade Powerleague Sportsdome opposite to Old Trafford, Manchester Giants offer the chance to catch professional basketball in the heart of Manchester. Another team to recently reform is the Manchester Storm ice hockey team.

Back Country walks plus top pubs in Greater Manchester By Visit Manchester on Jun. 11, 2021 4 min read by\u00a0Polly Checkland Manchester\u2019s connectedness to the wider countryside is one of the city\u2019s best assets. Numerous walks with stunning views are reachable by a direct train ride from the city centre; better still, these routes are easily paired with some of the region\u2019s best pubs. Picture this: a morning walking through woodland and perfumed heather before arriving, properly hungry, at a traditional boozer. Open fires in the winter, beer gardens in summer, and an impressive menu year-round \u2013 it\u2019s the ideal formula for a restorative weekend, which is why we\u2019ve put together this guide to country walks plus some of Greater Manchester\u2019s top pubs. Marsden Moor and The Riverhead Brewery Tap The village of Marsden in the South Pennines is a half hour train from the city centre, and the starting point for walks skirting the beautiful Butterley Reservoir, the flat tops of the moors or up Deer Hill. The National Trust has maps for a selection of great routes , also outlining time, distance and difficulty; whichever you choose, we recommend ending up at The Riverhead Brewery Tap back in Marsden, where pints and traditional food are served next to the River Colne. Tegg\u2019s Nose, Macclesfield Forest and RedWillow Combine a climb up Tegg\u2019s Nose and a ramble around Macclesfield Forest with a pint at RedWillow , before catching a 21 minute train from Macclesfield station if you\u2019re heading back to the city centre. Chinley Churn and The Old Hall Inn Chinley Among the various routes that radiate out from Chinley, only a 34 minute train from Manchester Piccadilly, is a loop that scales Chinley Churn for views across to Kinder Scout and the Peak District (on clear days) before returning to the village. Award-winning local ale house The Old Hall Inn is your reward, where an excellent menu is served in a quintessential country pub; sister inn The Paper Mill , which dishes out enviable pizzas, is opposite. Quarry Bank + The Ship, Styal National Trust property Quarry Bank is brilliant for short walks \u2013 particularly when proper local pub The Ship is only a 13 minute walk away. Both are reachable from Manchester by trains to Styal station. New Mills and The Shrub Club New Mills in the High Peak is a rightfully popular starting point for walkers: serviced by two train lines (New Mills Central and Newtown) the village stands above a rocky gorge known as The Torrs. A steep descent leads to the Torrs Riverside Park, a peaceful path that links the Sett Valley Trail with the Goyt Way and Midshires Way via the dramatic arch of the Millennium Walkway. Reachable from here is the Torr Vale Mill, where cocktail bar with unbeatable views The Shrub Club is located. Dunham Massey and the Swan with Two Nicks It\u2019s a classic combination: explore Dunham Massey \u2019s deer park before climbing over the Little Bollington stile and following a path through fields to The Swan with Two Nicks . The exposed beams and log fires in this rustic country pub have featured in TV programmes including Cold Feet and Coronation Street, while the comforting menu has long sated tired walkers. The Parkers Arms, Clitheroe loop There are few nicer things than a stay or visit to The Parkers Arms near Clitheroe \u2013 especially if you whet your appetite for the outstanding food here on this 5 mile circular hike . Etherow Country Park and Libby\u2019s Bread and Wine Our next pick is less of a pub, more of a restaurant \u2013 but pairing a walk around the wooded paths of Etherow Country Park with a meal at riverside spot Libby\u2019s Bread and Wine is hard to beat. Catch the train to and from Marple station, and make your way through Brabyns Park for an off-road route to the nature reserve and lake. The Pack Horse and Kinder Reservoir Another National Trust route, this walk begins at Bowden, with Hayfield and its much-lauded pub The Pack Horse part way around a loop that circles Kinder Reservoir. Alternatively, make Hayfield your start and end point if you\u2019d rather not contemplate hiking with a full stomach. Sowerby Bridge to The Moorcock Inn For a short and to the point route to The Moorcock Inn , dubbed \u2018head-spinningly good\u2019 by Jay Rayner in the Guardian, follow Google maps for 40 minutes from Sowerby Bridge station, up steep inclines with admittedly stunning views. The food and wine are so good here, you might want to catch a taxi back... Hebden Bridge to Heptonstall and the Fox & Goose A circular hike from Hebden Bridge (around half an hour by train from Manchester) up to hillside village and Sylvia Plath\u2019s burial place Heptonstall should, by all rights, end at much-loved community pub the Fox & Goose . Pick a route on the stone paths through Eaves Wood, and enjoy a pint, vegan pasty and game of darts on your return. Ramsbottom circular and the Eagle and Child Finally, follow this circular walk from Ramsbottom for spectacular views from Peel Tower, a monument to Robert Peel, before putting your feet up at award-winning pub the Eagle and Child .

Back Best Boxing Day Walks in Greater Manchester By Visit Manchester on Dec. 11, 2025 9 min read Once the last mince pie has mysteriously vanished and the festive films start repeating themselves, a Boxing Day walk can be the perfect excuse to get out into the fresh air. Whether you\u2019re looking for gentle, accessible routes around Greater Manchester, something scenic to clear the post-Christmas cobwebs, or a proper stretch of the legs after a hearty dinner, Manchester and its surrounding boroughs have no shortage of options. From peaceful reservoir paths in Stockport and Oldham to winter wanders in Salford and Trafford, it\u2019s a brilliant time to explore the region at your own pace. Think crisp air, wide views, and enough space for everyone - families, buggies, dogs, and anyone who simply fancies a relaxed stroll. Explore Greater Manchester Grab your friends and family, hop on a train, tram or into the car, and see what Greater Manchester and its neighbouring towns have to offer.\u00a0Whether you want a tougher route or an easy lakeside walk, there\u2019s plenty to discover this season. Here's our top picks this Boxing Day: 1. Bolton: Turton and Entwistle Reservoir and Winter Hill Bolton offers some great scenic, peaceful walks this\u00a0time of the year. If you're after a circular trail\u00a0that's flat the whole way around, you'll\u00a0enjoy Turton and Entwistle Reservoir, but if you're looking\u00a0for a challenge, head to Winter Hill. The climb might leave you a little out of breath, but the views are worth every step. On a clear day, you can see right across the Northwest, and sometimes even catch a glimpse of the snowy Welsh mountains in the distance.

Bury: Peel Tower and Nuttall Park Peel Tower, Holcombe Moor and Ramsbottom is a local favourite, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The path up to Peel Tower is short but rewarding, and the view from the top is stunning on a crisp winter morning. You can even see the Manchester skylines\u00a0from up there!\u00a0Afterwards, wander down into Ramsbottom for a well-earned hot chocolate or coffee. Nuttall Park is another local favourite, perfect for the little ones and an easy, flat route the whole way around. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Martin Howard (@martin.howard.photo) 3. Manchester: Heaton Park and Castlefield You don\u2019t have to leave the city to find a bit of winter peace. Heaton Park is lovely this time of year, with frosted trees, quiet paths, and views looking out to the city. It\u2019s a great spot for a slow walk with family, friends, or your four-legged companion. If you\u2019re looking for a more urban walk this winter, then the Castlefield neighbourhood is a must-visit! Castlefield, located at the south-west end of Deansgate, is the industrial and Roman heart of Manchester. It is home to a Roman fort, networks of canals, old mills, cosy pubs like The Wharf and\u00a0restaurants. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 4. Tameside: GM Ringway, Werneth\u00a0Low Country Park and\u00a0Stalybridge Country Park The GM Ringway Walking Trail runs through riversides, moorlands, and pretty market towns, making Tameside a great place to explore a stretch of the route. It\u2019s a mix of open views and cosy corners with plenty of cafes and local pubs to stop in along the way. Werneth Low Country Park is a local favourite hillside park\u00a0offering some of the best panoramic views in the area, looking out over Manchester and the Pennines. It\u2019s popular for a leisurely\u00a0stroll and gorgeous for watching the sunset, even in winter. You may also want to explore Stalybridge and its independent scene. A popular walk is\u00a0Stalybridge Country Park, where you can enjoy a large stretch of moorland, woodland\u00a0and reservoirs above Stalybridge. Ideal for a Boxing Day natter, spotting wildlife and taking in scenic\u00a0views across the Tame Valley. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Roberts (@sarahr_instasnaps) 5.\u00a0Oldham: Dovestone Reservoir Set on the edge of the Peak District, Dovestone Reservoir looks especially beautiful in winter. It\u2019s a rather challenging walk if you decide to go up into\u00a0the hills, but equally rewards you with scenic views on a clear day.\u00a0If you're just planning to walk around the reservoir,\u00a0it's a relatively easy, flat walk. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Matt Cooke (@_matt_cooke) 6.\u00a0Rochdale: Hollingworth Lake Hollingworth Lake is a classic spot for a winter walk. It\u2019s a flat path with lovely views, and there\u2019s always a good chance of spotting some wildlife along the water\u2019s edge. When you\u2019re done, grab a warm drink in one of the lakeside cafes. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 7. Salford: Worsley Village With its canal paths and timber-framed cottages, Worsley Village feels like it was made for winter. It\u2019s calm, pretty, and full of charm \u2013 the kind of place that looks like it belongs on a Christmas card. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) 8. Stockport: Bramall Hall and Park and Alderley Edge Bramall Hall is a hidden gem tucked away in Stockport . It\u2019s a beautiful old manor house surrounded by parkland and perfect for a winter\u2019s walk. After exploring its history, be sure to stop by the caf\u00e9 for something warm and sweet. Just a short car or train ride outside of Manchester, you'll find\u00a0Alderley Edge.\u00a0Alderley Edge is beautiful in winter, with easy countryside walks and a viewpoint that offers great views across Cheshire. The village has a cosy, charming feel that really does make you feel like you\u2019ve stepped into The Holiday . View this post on Instagram A post shared by thebubbleroom (@thebubbleroom) 9. Trafford: Dunham Massey Few places capture the season quite like Dunham Massey . Deer wander quietly through the frosty grass and the old estate looks something out of a Christmas film. If you can, visit around dusk, it feels like you\u2019ve stepped into another world. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dunham Massey National Trust (@ntdunhammassey) 10. Wigan: Pennington Flash and\u00a0Haigh Hall and Woodland\u00a0Park If you\u2019re after a lakeside walk, Pennington Flash is the place to go. The lakeside paths are wide and open, and there\u2019s always plenty of birdlife to spot. It\u2019s one of those places that makes you instantly relax. Another popular winter walk is Haigh Hall and Woodland\u00a0Park .\u00a0The trails wind through woodland and open spaces, and there\u2019s a lake and historic Haigh Hall to see along the way. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Greg S Knight (@its.a.lumix.moment) 11. The Peaks, Cheshire & Derbyshire If you\u2019re happy to venture a little beyond the city, the Peak District and the rolling landscapes of Cheshire and Derbyshire offer some of the best winter walking in the country. You\u2019ll find everything from short, easy circular trails with big views to iconic hilltops and moorland routes that feel surprisingly wild for somewhere so close to Manchester. Here's our top 4 picks: For something dramatic but doable, Mam Tor \u2019s circular path is a favourite -\u00a0a steady climb with huge panoramas and a route that\u2019s usually manageable even in winter conditions. If you prefer something with a touch of mystery, Lud\u2019s Church is a brilliant choice: a deep, moss-covered chasm tucked into the forest near Gradbach, perfect for a slow, atmospheric wander. Tegg\u2019s Nose Country Park near Macclesfield is another crowd-pleaser, offering a mix of rugged old quarries, woodland, and gentle trails. Over in Glossop and the Dark Peak, there are moorland walks that feel wonderfully remote, while places like Castleton, Buxton and Rowarth make lovely bases for shorter, scenic loops followed by a warm drink in a village caf\u00e9. Wherever you go, you\u2019ll find options for all abilities, from easy family-friendly paths to more invigorating routes if you\u2019re in the mood to walk off your Christmas dinner. Whether you stay local or head a little further into the hills, a Boxing Day walk is a simple, refreshing way to round off the holiday. Manchester\u2019s mix of accessible paths, peaceful reservoirs, forest trails and nearby Peak District gems means there\u2019s a route for every tempo -\u00a0slow, steady, or spirited. Wrap up warm, bring a flask, and enjoy a winter wander that feels like a treat rather than a task. Fresh air, good company, and a change of scenery: it\u2019s hard to think of a better way to ease into the stretch between Christmas and the New Year.

Dovestone Reservoir Explore Manchester's countryside North of the city - around the towns of Bury, Bolton, Wigan, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford and Tameside - you'll find more than 500 square miles of inspiring countryside, crisscrossed by historical waterways and dotted with picturesque towns and fascinating attractions that make for great days out of the city. For pure peaceful escape from the hurly burly of the city, dip into the region's country parks. In the heart of Wigan, Haigh Hall and Country Park offers 40 miles of secluded woodland trails and canal towpaths running through 250 acres of park and woodland. A walk round beautiful Dovestone Reservoir takes about an hour, and the picturesque Pennine village of Saddleworth is another highlight. The exhilarating South and West Pennine Moors run through the region too, offering miles of cycleways and bridleways for walkers and riders to recharge and unwind in the great outdoors. Look out for, Hollingworth Lake in Rochdale, once a traditional destination for local mill workers, it sits in a popular country park and is an ideal gateway to the South Pennines. North Manchester is crisscrossed by canals, a lasting reminder of Manchester's industrial heritage. Today they provide tranquil, traffic-free cycling routes, places of historical significance, havens for wildlife, heritage trails and peaceful picnic sites. The Rochdale Canal is the broad waterway that opened up the route through the valleys to the magnificent Pennine moors. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal , which flows through the villages of Oldham, has the unusual bonus of a canal-side sculpture trail for you to take in too. North Manchester has many historic towns and villages that are well worth a visit. The picturesque Saddleworth villages of Diggle, Dobcross and Uppermill are surrounded by dramatic Pennine moorland. Over in Bolton there's also lovely Smithills Hall , a restored fourteenth-century Lancashire manor house with formal gardens, and Hall I'th' Wood, a part-timbered Tudor merchant's house where Samuel Crompton invented the revolutionary \"spinning mule\" in 1779. For the energetic, a climb from Ramsbottom, a town on the East Lancashire Railway, up to the Peel Tower on Holcombe Hill will leave you with spectacular views. Relax afterwards with a visit to the popular Shoulder of Mutton pub in Holcombe Village near Bury.

Back Sustainability at the newly open Power Hall at the Science and Industry Museum By Visit Manchester on Nov. 28, 2025 3 min read Header Image Credit:\u00a0Credit Dave Bewick \/ Science and Industry Museum Power Hall: The Andrew Law Gallery at the Science and Industry Museum has reopened, and it is now telling a new story. This building once played a major role in the Industrial Revolution, when coal-powered engines helped change the world. Today, Power Hall is part of a different kind of revolution, one focused on clean energy and a greener future for Manchester. A Historic Building Made More Sustainable In order to operate sustainably and comfortably, the Power Hall has undergone careful and extensive renovation. The building\u2019s roof, which stretches the length of a Premier League football pitch, was fully restored using as many original tiles as possible in order to protect its historic character while improving insulation. Additional work has repaired the timber structure, updated drainage systems to cope with increasing rainfall and installed new roof lights to retain heat more effectively. Sustainable wood-fibre insulation, made from timber industry by-products, has been installed throughout, lowering the building\u2019s carbon emissions. Energy-efficient windows and doors now help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature, while a new digital management system monitors and controls energy use across the gallery. These changes allow the museum to conserve its historic structure and collections more responsibly, creating a more comfortable environment for visitors and significantly reducing the building\u2019s environmental impact. Credit Drew Forsyth \/ Science and Industry Museum Heating the Hall One of the most exciting upgrades is a new heating system that uses natural water from deep underground. Water is pumped up from an aquifer beneath the museum and passed through special heat pumps that gently warm the building. This replaces old heating systems that relied on burning gas or coal. The steam engines in the Power Hall still run as part of the visitor experience, but now the steam produced is captured and used to warm the gallery. Any water used in the system is safely returned back underground or to the nearby River Irwell. Because of this new system, the museum will produce far less carbon. In fact, the Power Hall\u2019s emissions are expected to drop by 60% by 2030. What You Can See and Learn Visitors can see these green technologies live in action throughout Power Hall. The new electric boiler and heat pumps are on display as the latest museum exhibit, and easy-to-follow signs explain how the system works. The steam engines still run, offering the familiar sights, sounds and movement that many people remember, but now they are powered in a much more sustainable way. Visitors can now also explore a wealth of people stories including people working in sustainable engineering roles in the city today. Image Credit:\u00a0Credit Dave Bewick \/ Science and Industry Museum Getting There Sustainably The museum is close to trains, Bee Network trams and bus routes, and only a short walk from several city centre stations if you prefer to active travel. Visitors are encouraged to travel by public transport, bike or on foot to help reduce their environmental impact. The Power Hall now stands as a powerful symbol of how the past can guide the future. By pairing historic engineering with modern climate solutions, the museum shows that sustainability and heritage can work together to inspire change.

Back Vintage Shops in Manchester City Centre By Visit Manchester on May 25, 2023 10 min read If there is one thing us Mancunian's are mad on - it's the way we style our selves. Just like the impact of our music, our fashion has also created waves in the fashion world and reflections of the Manchester style influence can be seen nationwide and WORLDwide.\u00a0Manchester is renowned for it's vintage clothing style which is funny because we have lots of vintage and retro clothes shops. However, to answer '\"What\u00a0came first? The chicken or the egg?,' I am not sure whether it was the shops that came first or the style - lets just call it a mix of the two. Anyway, I'll leave that thought with you as well as this list of all the vintage and retro shops located in Manchester City Centre. Bare Necessities 39 Parker St, Manchester M1 4AJ Located on the forever growing Oxford Road corridor, Bare Necessities opened its shop in 2019 to offer an alternative solution in the fight against fast fashion. Bare Necessities mission is to source the highest quality of second-hand retro and vintage clothing at the lowest possible price for their customers. The store is ideally located close to the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University grounds. Customers can expect to find an abundance of clothing organised in a beautiful rainbow to make your shopping experience more enjoyable and less tedious sifting. Lots of jeans, sweatshirts, dresses, shirts all at amazingly affordable prices. Thrift Shop 39 Parker St, Manchester M1 4AJ In the prime of the city centre, you can hop off the bus and walk straight into Thrift Shop store. Thrift Shop is part of the We Are Cow family, so you are guaranteed to find some cool and trendy vintage bits and pieces. What sets this shop apart from the rest is their nifty pricing scheme \u2013 rails with hangers in certain colours are priced at a set price and a good price at that too! Which is perfect if you\u2019re on a budget as you can shop in the suitable sections without any price jump scares. The rails are always full and vibrant, you may have to do some digging but the finds are so worth it! British Heart Foundation 51 Piccadilly, Manchester M1 2AP I know you have probably heard of The British Heart Foundation charity shop before, but what makes the one in Piccadilly Gardens extra special, is the fabulous vintage section located at the front of the shop. You can find some one-hit wonder items of clothing spanning back all the way from the 1940s. As always, the rest of the shop is filled with lots of other second-hand garments, as well as brand new with tags clothing from various brands such as Zara and Pretty Little Thing. I know, not exactly slow fashion but it\u2019s still closing the gap in the circle, and I guess a guilt-free way of buying a fast-fashion garment. Empire Exchange 1 Newton St, Manchester M1 1HW To pre-warn this shop is rather whacky and should definitely be renamed to The Eccentric Empire Exchange Emporium . If you do not manage to hear the shop via the retro sound system blasting some classic vinyl records out of the front, then you can find the shop manually on Newton Street just off Piccadilly Gardens. This second-hand, collectables shop has been going strong for over 35 years and has been left in a time frozen bubble ever since, stepping down into this lair, if you dare, is like taking a trip down memory lane. A cave full of nostalgic treasures, from vinyl to CDs (CDS? What are they?), to trinkets, comics, and ginormous props from the BBC, as well as a naughty adult corner for some vintage X-rated content. The iconic Empire Exchange Emporium is a place that is so vintage you could go in and come out forgetting what year it is! We encourage everyone to visit this iconic shop, as we must protect it at all costs from the big corporate shops taking over! Blue Rinse 1 Newton St, Manchester M1 1HW Blue Rinse started off as an online vintage clothing company and now they have 2 physical stores with 1 choosing to open its doors here in Manchester! Don\u2019t get me wrong, online shopping is very fun and convenient but to be able try before you buy, especially with vintage clothing it is quite the blessing. Alongside the regular stock of vintage clothing, Blue Rinse sell their very own range of reworked clothing. All of the items of clothing are one-off pieces \u2013 haute-couture if you will, handmade by the brilliant team at Blue Rinse . What I love most about this shop is the number of cool accessories, from funky earrings, to wavy sunglasses, tremendous ties, bags \u2013 they even sell braces for your trousers! Now that\u2019s what I call true vintage. Pop Boutique 34 - 36 Oldham St, Manchester M1 1JN Pop Boutique was founded back in 1983 and its first permanent shop was opened inside our very own Affleck's Palace\u00a0in 1985. Nowadays, you can still find this fragment of history and take yourself back to shopping like its 1985 in Affleck\u2019s Palace, or you can visit their larger independent store, located opposite Afflecks\u00a0on Oldham\u2019s Street. Pop Boutique is still as much of a shrine to vintage shoppers as it was back in the 80s. You can guarantee all clothing is of a high-quality and you\u2019re guaranteed to exit the shop with a real vintage treasure. The layout is impeccable with rails and rails and rails and rails, plus mannequins and yes, you guessed it, more rails. Included in these rails are vintage Levi\u2019s jackets and jeans, as well as silk shirts, retro sweaters and all the bits in between\u2026You can also find completely one-off pieces by shopping through their rePop range of recycled materials turned into new garments, which compete with the current trending silhouettes without the fast-fashion guilt. Afflecks 52 Church St, Manchester M4 1PW Warning, you might get lost in the iconic Afflecks but it\u2019s so worth it because when you eventually make your way out, you\u2019ll be leaving with a whole new and extremely trendy wardrobe. There are multiple shops full of trinkets, retro gadgets, copious badges, plants, incense sticks in every flavour, tattoo parlours, piercing shops, vinyl and tapes and of course, lots of pre-loved vintage clobber! Beg, Steal, Borrow Second floor A personal favourite, (if that is allowed) would be Beg, Steal, Borrow , located on the second floor of Afflecks. The shop is like taking a step into a 2000s groovy chick\u2019s dream bedroom! The pink painted walls are decorated with iconic 2000s memorabilia including fluffy telephones and funky framed mirrors. Clothing wise, there are lots to choose from, clothing is carefully sorted into separate rails for dresses, skirts, jackets, trousers and clearly labelled in sizes. There are also an abundance of bags and shoes, which for a vintage shop there aren\u2019t many genuine vintage shoes. The clothing is reasonably priced and there are also boxes where you can dig and find some real bargains! The staff are also as equally friendly to the level of trendy they are. A particular service that Beg, Steal, Borrow offer is a trade in.

With a mix of cuisines and flavours all under one roof, what could be better? In the last few years, street food halls have become a firm favourite with Manchester\u2019s residents and visitors alike, and it\u2019s a good job we have plenty to choose from. With street food vendors ranging from the authentic to the quirky, street food halls offer a place for some of the most exciting up-and-coming chefs to make the food they love at a reasonable price, and we can all benefit. Some of Manchester\u2019s previous street food offerings have now become some of our best-loved restaurants, with food halls giving talented chef\u2019s a much-needed platform to show what they can do. Far from the days of street food meaning a single lonely burger van, Greater Manchester\u2019s Street food scene has exploded in recent years with establishments popping up all over the city-region. Foodies love the fuss-free, casual nature of these places but also the chance to try something new without a hefty price tag. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re looking for a quick bite or to spend an afternoon with friends trying a mix of foods and drinks as you go, street food halls offer quality, delicious food and great places to chill. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the best street food markets and food halls, so that next time you\u2019re searching for a bite to eat, you know where to go. Mackie Mayor On the edge of Manchester\u2019s beloved Northern Quarter, you\u2019ll find a Grade II listed market building (the only remaining building from the Smithfield market) which is now home to some of Manchester\u2019s favourite street food vendors. Mackie Mayor is a modern food hall which has precisely the urban, relaxed vibe you\u2019d expect from its location.

Back Back with a bang! Manchester's fireworks displays set to return from 2026 By Visit Manchester on Nov. 27, 2025 2 min read Council-organised firework displays in Manchester\u2019s parks are set to return from next year, it has been revealed. The popular events have not been held since 2019 when they could not take place because of the Covid pandemic. Following that, they remained paused on a trial basis while the Council sought to reprioritise funding to support a wider range of free community events across the city throughout autumn and winter. But the door was never shut on their potential return and now an improving financial position means that the Council is in a position to bring firework events back, while continuing to support other community events. Papers setting out the Council\u2019s financial position as it prepares to set its budget for 2026\/27, being considered by scrutiny committees next week (week commencing 1 December) show that fairer funding being introduced by the Government next year will leave the Council better off than previously anticipated. This reintroduces the principle that the amount of money councils are given should be linked to the level of challenges and needs in their area. This link was severed by the Coalition Government elected in 2010, which saw Manchester among the places hardest hit by funding cuts and unfunded pressures such as increased demand for care services. While the exact financial settlement will not be received until late December this year, it is anticipated that the fairer funding formula will see more money for frontline services and support for vulnerable people. Pressures remain after so many years of cuts but this creates the opportunity not just to protect frontline services but to invest in the things which residents have said matter the most to them - and begin to build back some of the things which were hit by austerity. The proposal to bring back fireworks event is one such example. Council Leader Cllr Bev Craig said: \u201cManchester prides itself on free community events and we know many people have missed Bonfire night firework spectaculars. That\u2019s why we are pleased to confirm they\u2019ll be back by popular demand in 2026. \u201cWe know that generations of Mancunians have enjoyed council-organised displays and that free family events are a great way to bring people together. \u201cThat\u2019s why when funding was squeezed we sought to support a wider range of community events over a longer period. \u201cBut now that this Government is actually investing in councils like ours rather than the cuts we had from Governments since 2010, we can bring back bonfire events while continuing to back other free events across the city. \u201cIn the coming months we will talk about our investments in communities, cleaning our streets, frontline services, young people and many more initiatives that will make Manchester better, but for now here\u2019s one example of reversing cuts to our city and building up for a spectacular 2026.\u201d Explore More of Manchester...

Back The story behind the Manchester bee \u2013 and why it\u2019s used everywhere in the city By Visit Manchester on Mar. 20, 2020 6 min read By Anne Beswick There are bees all over Manchester, swarms of those sweetest and busiest of insects are everywhere. Even in the depths of winter they are here, on every bollard and bench, on buildings and bins all over our city. The bee is the symbol of Manchester and this city of industry is rightly proud of its link with the hard-working insect. In 1842,\u00a0the early city fathers had to decide on a coat of arms that would tell the world who we were. It was a Victorian branding exercise. They included a globe with seven bees to show how we worked and traded across the seven seas. The Manchester bee was born of industry. Manchester\u2019s bee is a worker bee, reflecting a city made by the workers; made by the people, not a city that has grown from royal patronage or easy natural resources. Mancunians have worked hard to make this place thrive. The standard bee on our street furniture has been around since the 1970s but most of our bees are 19 th century creations. Bee-spotting is a good way to spend time in the city. When you\u2019re strolling the streets, look up, look around and you\u2019ll see them everywhere. On the coat of arms on the exterior of Manchester Town Hall - which is currently undertaking a large refurbishment to lovingly return it to its 1868 splendour - you will find the busy worker bees proudly displayed. You\u2019ll see lots of references to cotton on the building, and cotton was the industry that made Manchester rich, the city\u2019s equivalent of honey. More bees can be found at Spring Gardens, Hotel Gotham and Zizzi in King Street has a fine traditional beehive in the window that you can view whilst walking past. There is Beehive mill in Ancoats, and St Ann\u2019s Square has oversized 1980s bees opposite the Royal Exchange . Stroll down to the Kimpton Clocktower on Oxford Road and look way up, at the clock face where bees tell the quarter hours. The ancient-and-modern University of Manchester also has three large bee symbols on its coat of arms. Manchester claimed the bee because she is an industrious little grafter, individually insignificant but collectively a superorganism. Together we are stronger. And bees are amazing; jaw-droppingly stunning. An individual worker bee lives for about three weeks in the busiest summer months. She visits between 50 to 100 flowers on each flight and up to 2,000 flowers daily. As well as producing honey she makes beeswax, propolis (a sort of disinfectant that is plastered around the entrance to the hive) and royal jelly to feed the queen. Worker bees are all female whilst the males are called drones. The latter are useful for one thing then they are thrown out of the hive and the females get on with all the work.\u00a0 Please consider this and draw your own conclusions. Just remember that Manchester is well-known for its strong women! Emmeline Pankhurst, Enriqueta Rylands, Dame Nancy Rothwell, Maxine Peake, to name a few. The special thing about the human relationship with bees is that we can control them and exploit their products. Honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) are the only insects that have been domesticated and have been since at least the days of the ancient Egyptians. Jars of honey were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The Old English custom of \u201ctelling the bees\u201d reflects the close bond between beekeeper and bee-kept. This commands that all major family issues (births, marriages and deaths but general gossip too) must be reported to the bees or they will fly off, die, or fail to produce honey. This could be seen as a quaint old custom or just a way of encouraging that proper attention is paid to the hive. And Manchester did not always pay good attention to her adopted insects. One thing we are not so proud of hereabouts is that we practically invented air pollution or, at least, the Industrial Revolution left us with a legacy of biological degradation second to none. We have spent many years rebuilding our environment and connecting back with the wider world around us and this means that our bees are back! There are beehives all around the city, on top of the Cathedral , the Printworks , Manchester Art Gallery , Manchester Central conference centre and even on some commercial buildings around the city. These bees are lovingly tended to by volunteers with an evangelical zeal for their new charges. Come the warmer days of spring and summer, real honeybees flit above our heads, busy as Mancunians. Proper Manchester honey can even be bought in some of the associated buildings and their shops. The Manchester and District beekeepers Association (mdbka.com) has its home at Heaton Park just north of the city where you can see a demonstration hive and get lots of information and advice if you wish to give beekeeping a go. We can all help the bees. Even if you don\u2019t think that baggy combination of white canvas and netting is quite your look you can do your bit by putting out food for bees. They need flowers; simple, open flowers from spring to autumn. They like native and exotic species equally; bees aren\u2019t prejudiced, as long as there is nectar, pollen and easy access. You can be part of this and grow your own bee-friendly flowers. In the Spring, bees love; rosemary, pussy willow, bluebell, primrose, and Hawthorne. Mid-summer calls for other plants such as; foxglove, honeysuckle, sage, clover, geranium, teasel, and thyme; and bee-friendly plants that grow in late Summer\/Autumn include; buddleia, heather, lavender, marjoram, sedum, and Ivy. In Manchester, flowers are coming back too. Planters are dotted about, flowering green walls appearing, gardens are springing up in previously unlikely spaces and sympathetic apartment dwellers are planting windowsills and balconies and welcoming the bees. Local people are working together to blur the division between urban and rural and the bees are back. Manchester is back too. After many mid-twentieth century years in the doldrums, this city is on a rapid ascent. As well as all the business, sport, culture and conferences, tourists are coming in ever-larger numbers. Before the Industrial Revolution bees made honey and people loved it.\u00a0 Industry turned the world upside down forever. Manchester, the original, modern city was born. Now the city is growing up and linking back to the best bits of the past.\u00a0 Welcome home bees.

Bridgewater Canal in Sale Explore Trafford The home of Manchester United Football Club and Emirates Old Trafford , Trafford is widely held as an international sporting destination, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\u00a0For adrenaline junkies Chill Factore is the ideal tourist destination,\u00a0the UK\u2019s longest and widest real snow indoor slope,\u202fat 100 metres wide and 180 metres long. If history is what you're looking for, head to the\u00a0banks of the\u00a0Manchester Ship\u00a0Canal\u00a0and the Imperial War Museum North , an extraordinary exhibition space that delivers an immersive experience\u202fdocumenting\u202fthe\u202fvoices of ordinary people of over a century of war, plus, while you're there,\u202fyou can\u00a0make your way over to the cobbles for a tour of the world's longest running soap, Coronation Street . Trafford\u00a0boasts\u00a0history and heritage\u00a0with over 200 listed buildings, including the beautiful 18th-century Dunham Massey , and is home to a plethora of\u202foutstanding nature reserves. Highlighting the natural beauty and countryside in Trafford, Sale Water Park includes an incredible 52-acre lake which is also the site of the Broad\u00a0Ees\u00a0Dole wildlife refuge, a local nature reserve which provides a home for migratory birds. When it comes to entertainment, and shopping, The Trafford Centre has it all under one roof. With hundreds of stores, including the first Selfridges outside of London, a 20-screen Odeon multiplex cinema, a Laser Quest arena, Paradise Island miniature golf and a Namco\u00a0Funscape\u00a0arcade and bowling alley and Europe\u2019s largest food court, it really does cater for all tastes. Plus, Trafford comprises\u00a0the towns of Sale, Stretford, Altrincham, and Urmston, meaning there\u2019s even more to explore. Discover Trafford: Manchester\u2019s metropolitan borough This in-depth guide to Trafford covers the very best things to do locally \u2013 from browsing an artisan market in Urmston to ice skating in Altrincham. Situated to the south west of Manchester city centre, the borough of Trafford spans historic sporting grounds, over 200 listed buildings and beautiful green spaces. The home of Manchester United Football Club and Lancashire County Cricket Club, this is also the area to visit if you fancy a spot of indoor skiing or exploring an inflatable theme park. From the staggering exhibitions at IWM North through to gigs at Victoria Warehouse and films at the plush Everyman Altrincham, Trafford has no shortage of cultural things to do. Head to the independent restaurants and bars in Urmston or Stretford Food Hall for refreshments, to Dunham Massey or Walkden Gardens for an escape into nature. Trafford has it all. It\u2019s also an area that\u2019s easy to navigate. The borough is bordered by the Manchester Ship Canal on one side, with the Bridgewater Way providing a walking and cycling link from the city centre through to the towns of Old Trafford, Stretford, Sale and Altrincham. Old Trafford and Trafford Park occupy the northernmost part of the borough, closest to Manchester city centre, with Urmston to the south east, Stretford to the south west, Sale below this and Altrincham towards the southern edge of the district. With train, tram and bus routes connecting the best things to see and do locally, you can cover a lot of ground in a day. Old Trafford and Trafford Park are the borough\u2019s sporting strongholds. Close to the Old Trafford tram stop is the world-famous home of Manchester United Football Club, Old Trafford Stadium . Matches here are always electric, and you can visit on non-match days for a museum and stadium tour. See the players\u2019 tunnel, walk next to the iconic pitch and drop into the dugouts. Hotel Football, with its rooms, restaurant and matchday hospitality, is nearby, while the similarly historic Emirates Old Trafford cricket ground is just a 15 minute walk away. If you fancy dabbling in a spot of exercise yourself, head to the inflatable arena at Inflata Nation , or for the frozen slopes at Chill Factore, Manchester\u2019s \u00a331m real snow centre. The closest tram stop to Inflata Nation is Parkway, while Chill Factore is only a 15 minute walk from the new Trafford Centre Metrolink. There\u2019s more to this area than sport, however. The OT Art Trail , funded by Arts Council England, has seen the walls in a triangle of streets east of the cricket ground decorated with murals. Trafford Ecology Park is a beautiful green oasis close to the ship canal, open to the public most weekdays and available to book for corporate volunteering, environmental training and outdoor learning activities. Easily reachable from both the Old Trafford and Pomona tram stops, Victoria Warehouse is an events venue and hotel all under one roof, host to gigs, exhibitions and sporting fixtures, while Sea Life Manchester transports its visitors into an incredible underwater world. The aquarium is based at the Trafford Centre, a one-stop shopping and leisure destination, and now on the new Metrolink tram line that leads back into the city centre. Also with its own Metrolink stop is IWM North, a national museum reflecting on conflict and its impact. Winner of multiple awards and home to J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s revolver from the Battle of the Somme, IWM North is recognised as one of the top four Large Visitor attractions in the country. Urmston Urmston is to the south of the Trafford Centre, and has been undergoing a bit of a revamp in recent years. In the town centre, there\u2019s a highly rated pub and beer shop Prairie Schooner Taphouse , as well as wine bar and shop Kelder Wines and The Steamhouse, a pub in a refurbished station building. Urmston\u2019s Eden Square shopping complex is a hub of high street stores, while the monthly Urmston Artisan Market brings street food, vintage and crafts to the Golden Hill car park, just six minutes\u2019 walk from the town\u2019s train station. For a slice of green space with a miniature railway, Abbotsfield Park isn\u2019t far \u2013 alternatively, head to either Davyhulme Park Golf Club or Flixton Golf Club to spend a pleasant few hours navigating the green. Stretford Best reached on the tram from the city centre, or by following the Bridgewater Canal on foot or by bike, Stretford is to the east of Urmston. The town centre is at the crossroads of a major junction, with Stretford Mall on one side and Stretford Public Hall on the other. Stretford Mall is home to a Food Hall, complete with street food stalls, a craft beer bar and coffee counter, as well as The Longford Tap , a popular bar in Stretford selling craft beers, cask ales, wine and spirits. The monthly Stretford Precinct Market also takes place here on the last Saturday of the month, bringing fresh produce, crafts, gifts, food and more to the town centre. Stretford Public Hall , meanwhile, hosts classes, activities and events in a community-owned, multi-purpose building. Sale Sale is south of Stretford, the next stop on the Metrolink and only an 11 minute cycle via the Bridgewater Canal. The Square shopping centre in this already popular town is about to undergo a \u00a370m transformation \u2013\u00a0but for now there\u2019s still plenty to make a visit worthwhile. The Waterside arts centre has long been host to fascinating exhibitions, events and theatre, and is classed as an important regional hub for both performance and visual art. Look out for the monthly Makers Market in Stanley Square, or you might want to pair a circular walk to Sale Water Park, where there\u2019s a lake, woodland, meadows, eateries and the Trafford Water Sports Centre, with a meal at The Bridge Pub and Dining . Walkden Gardens, in the opposite direction, would work equally well for a stroll: this small but beautiful series of gardens is occasionally host to performances and special events. Altrincham Another four stops on the tram is Altrincham : here, shops, restaurants and bars radiate out towards Altrincham Market, occupying a mixture of buildings both modern and historic. Opened in 2014, the market itself helped to drive the transformation of the town centre. With incredible food traders occupying a beautiful market building and outdoor stalls to one side, Altrincham Market gets very busy, but is always worth the wait. One street away is the Everyman Altrincham cinema, where there\u2019s plush armchair seating and waiter service during the screenings, or a short walk away is the Planet Ice skating rink. Explore the town\u2019s bustling Stamford Quarter, and stop by Gran T\u2019s Coffee House for sandwiches and freshly-baked pastries. The town\u2019s two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and Altrincham Little Theatre , both a little way out of the centre, are also well worth a visit. Finally, no guide to Trafford would be complete without mentioning Dunham Massey, a beautiful garden and treasure-filled house situated within an ancient deer park. This National Trust property is a joy to explore: around an hour\u2019s walk south from Altrincham, the estate is a short diversion from the Bridgewater Way by bike. This handy map outlines the walking route and bus stops nearby.

Back Celebrating Manchester\u2019s Music Scene During the BRITs and MOBOs \u2014 Ticket or No Ticket By Visit Manchester on Dec. 05, 2025 8 min read Manchester\u2019s about to take centre stage. With the BRIT Awards and the MOBOs both heading north, the city is gearing up for a year that will shine a fresh spotlight on its musical identity. The BRITs will break tradition by leaving London for the first time, taking over Co-op Live , and a few weeks later the MOBO Awards will arrive to celebrate three decades of championing Black music and culture. Tickets, unsurprisingly, will be\u00a0snapped up fast. But whether you\u2019ve managed to bag a seat inside the arena or not, Manchester is one of the UK\u2019s true music capitals. The streets, neighbourhoods and venues tell a story all of their own, and there\u2019s no shortage of ways to soak in the atmosphere. Legendary clubs, influential record labels, iconic murals and historic gig spots are scattered across the city, offering countless opportunities to dive into its musical past and present. This guide brings together some of the best ways to explore Manchester\u2019s musical heritage while the BRITs and MOBOs are in town \u2013 no ticket necessary. Manchester's BRIT Trophy The trophy, designed by Manchester-born designer Matthew Williamson , was unveiled at a special event celebrating the city\u2019s creative heritage and the University of Manchester\u2019s role in arts, design, music, and performance. The John Rylands Research Institute and Library , home to the British Pop Archive \u2013 the UK\u2019s first large-scale collection of popular and youth culture \u2013 highlighted the significance of the occasion. Williamson\u2019s design reflects Manchester\u2019s identity. Made from amber-toned resin, evoking the golden honey of the worker bee, the city\u2019s symbol of resilience, the trophy sits atop a globe representing the global reach of British music. Williamson joins a distinguished list of artists who have shaped the BRITs trophy, including Vivienne Westwood, Zaha Hadid, Tracey Emin, and Yinka Ilori. A City Soundtrack: Manchester\u2019s Popular Music History Manchester\u2019s music story isn\u2019t tucked away behind glass or hidden in museum cabinets. It\u2019s written into the fabric of the streets \u2013 in old mills turned venues, blue plaques marking revolutionary gigs and murals honouring the artists who shaped entire genres. The decision to host both major awards here in 2026 makes sense. Few cities have contributed as much to British music. Below are some of the key chapters in Manchester\u2019s popular musical journey. Pop & Early Rock While Liverpool often takes the spotlight for the 1960s, Manchester played a pivotal part in shaping the nation\u2019s pop and rock identity. The Bee Gees spent their early years in Chorlton before achieving global fame with their unmistakable harmonies, while The Hollies, formed in the city in 1962, became one of Britain\u2019s most successful bands of the era. Alongside this, all-night Caribbean clubs and Moss Side shebeens helped shape the city\u2019s cultural identity. They provided a familiar space for the West Indian community while introducing wider audiences to Black music - influences that would feed into the city\u2019s musical evolution for decades. Northern Soul Few movements capture Northern passion quite like Northern soul. Emerging in the early 1970s, it championed rare American soul records and created a dance culture unlike anything else. Manchester\u2019s Twisted Wheel became the heartbeat of the scene, attracting fans from across the country to its talc-dusted floors and all-night sessions. Its legacy still lives on, with Northern soul nights continuing throughout the city, including sets from the much-loved Deptford Northern Soul Club . Free Trade Hall The Free Trade Hall is a pillar of Manchester\u2019s musical heritage. Built in 1855, it hosted everything from classical recitals to genre-defining gigs. The most famous? The Sex Pistols\u2019 1976 performance \u2013 a night often credited with sparking Manchester\u2019s punk and post-punk scenes. In that audience were future members of Joy Division and The Smiths, key figures behind Factory Records, and journalists who would go on to shape the narrative of British music. What happened in that room would change the city\u2019s musical direction forever. Factory Records At the heart of Manchester\u2019s post-punk and early \u2018Madchester\u2019 movement was Factory Records. Co-founded by Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus, the label launched the careers of Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays, The Durutti Column and more. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Ha\u00e7ienda You can\u2019t talk about Manchester without mentioning the Ha\u00e7ienda. More than a nightclub, it was the epicentre of the city\u2019s rave culture and electronic explosion. Run by Factory Records and immortalised by its legendary DJs \u2013 including DJ Paulette, Graeme Park and Mike Pickering \u2013 it fuelled the rise of the \u2018Madchester\u2019 movement. The building may now be flats and apartments, but its impact reverberates far beyond Whitworth Street. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Smiths The Smiths helped define 1980s indie, pairing Johnny Marr\u2019s shimmering guitar work with Morrissey\u2019s lyrical bite. Their influence is global, and Manchester landmarks linked to them, such as Salford Lads\u2019 Club , have become essential stops for fans. You\u2019ll find murals dedicated to band members dotted around the city too, celebrating their legacy. Britpop & Oasis The 1990s brought a new wave exploded. Britpop, with Manchester once again at the forefront. While bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays laid much of the groundwork, Oasis became the era\u2019s defining act. Raised in Burnage, the Gallagher brothers turned small venues such as the Boardwalk into musical folklore. Even shops like Sifters Records became part of the story, immortalised in lyrics and loved by fans. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Visit Manchester Official (@visitmanchester) The Indie Wave of the 2000s The story didn\u2019t stop in the 1990s. Bands including The Courteeners, Blossoms and The 1975 kept Manchester on the indie map, honing their craft in grassroots venues across the city. By 2018, Manchester had been named the UK\u2019s rock and indie capital \u2013 a testament to its gig culture and thriving small venues such as the Manchester Academy complex. Rap & Grime Manchester\u2019s contribution to rap and grime is just as significant. The Ruthless Rap Assassins, formed in Hume, helped lay early foundations, blending punk and hip-hop influences. Kermit, one of the group\u2019s members, later joined Shaun Ryder in Black Grape, adding another chapter to Manchester\u2019s hybrid musical story. The city\u2019s modern wave, including Bugzy Malone and Aitch, has taken Manchester\u2019s voice nationwide. Their rise from local stages to festival headliners reflects a city that continually reinvents itself musically. Catch a Live Gig While You\u2019re Here Catching a live gig is a must. From the huge arenas \u2013 Co-op Live and AO Arena \u2013 to intimate pubs and independent venues, the city pulses with live music every night.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking PDF Share From Louise Bourgeois to Yoko Ono Tip Exhibition Jewellery by Female Artists With the special exhibition *\"From Louise Bourgeois to Yoko Ono. Jewelry by Women Artists \"*, the Museum of Applied Arts Cologne (MAKK) brings the fascinating world of women artists' jewelry to life for the first time. A novelty in Germany in this thematic depth, the exhibition shows around 90 pieces of jewelry by 45 pioneering female artists of the 20th and 21st centuries - including iconic positions such as Niki de Saint Phalle, Meret Oppenheim and Yoko Ono, but also surprising discoveries from contemporary art such as Alicja Kwade. Each work is more than just jewelry - it is a vision turned miniature. Whether minimalist forms, a strong sculptural presence or a playful sense of humor: the objects condense artistic trends of the time and transform them into wearable statements. As a tribute to female creativity, the exhibition deliberately breaks with conventions and opens up a new perspective on this field, which is often dominated by male perspectives. The field of tension oscillates between art, individuality and social attribution - from surrealist dreams to contemporary concepts. With this exhibition, the MAKK is building on the presentation \"Fascination Jewelry. 7000 Years of Jewelry Art at the MAKK\" and invites visitors to rediscover the museum as a place for innovative art education. The accompanying publication, published by the renowned arnoldsche Art Publishers, brings the exhibition to life far beyond Cologne - a collector's item. Immerse yourself in an artistic world of jewelry full of creativity, innovation and feminine expression! The exhibition runs until April 26, 2026.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking Carnival in Cologne K\u00f6lle alaaf! From pub to pub \u2014 in the open air: when the drum beats\u2026 When is Carnival? During the six days between Weiberfastnacht \u2014 the Women\u2019s Carnival \u2014 and Veilchendienstag \u2014 Violet Tuesday \u2014 the revellers, who are known as Jecken, come out in force to celebrate Carnival, which is also known as the \u201cfifth season\u201d of the year. As the saying has it, on Ash Wednesday it\u2019s all over \u2014 but in the meantime, Cologne is turned upside down all over again every year. In fact, the street Carnival actually starts in the Alter Markt (Old Market) at 11:11 a.m. on Thursday \u2014 Weiberfastnacht \u2014 and continues until the evening of Violet Tuesday. The Street Carnival in Cologne is a unique folk festival in the Rhineland that casts its spell over millions of visitors year after year. If you travel here to enjoy the age-old traditions of smooching and swaying, you\u2019re in good hands in the Carnival stronghold of Cologne with its 480 Carnival associations. The most important dates of the session Weiberfastnacht : Thursday, 12 February 2026 Carnival Friday : Friday, 13 February 2026 Carnival Saturday : Saturday, 14 February 2026 Carnival Sunday : Sunday, 15 February 2026 Rose Monday : Monday, 16 February 2026 Violet Tuesday : Tuesday, 17 February 2026 Ash Wednesday : Wednesday, 18 February 2026 Start of the session 2026\/2027 : Wednesday, 11 November 2026 Stunksitzung Events at a glance All info on street carnival FAQ 5 crazy days \u2014 from Weiberfastnacht to Violet Tuesday The Street Carnival officially begins on Thursday \u2014 Weiberfastnacht, or the Women\u2019s Carnival. In many neighbourhoods throughout the city, celebrations involve handing over the keys. Many companies throw their own Carnival parties, shops stay closed, and costumed celebrants flock to celebrate in their associations, favourite pubs or with friends. The fun starts in the early morning and continues until late at night in the Altstadt (Old Town) and the popular S\u00fcdstadt district. If you\u2019re wearing a tie, prepare for the worst: The tradition of \u201ccrazy women\u201d cutting off men\u2019s ties is still flourishing. The first Carnival parade marches through Cologne's old town on Weiberfastnacht. Street Carnival: sessions and parades Most of the Carnival sessions are held on Carnival Friday \u2014 and so are the traditional parades of Cologne\u2019s local Carnival associations, which converge in the city centre. Here the Carnival artists celebrate until the late evening. On Saturday morning, the Carnival association \u201cK\u00f6lsche Funke rut-wie\u00df vun 1823\u201d stages its \u201cFunkenbiwak\u201d open-air session on the Neumarkt (New Market). If you buy a \u201cFunkenstange\u201d beer glass, you can have it filled up with K\u00f6lsch at one of the beer stands free of charge. Some of the Veedelsz\u00fcge \u2014 the smaller local Carnival parades \u2014 are held in the various neighbourhoods on Saturday. Geisterzug, Veedelz\u00fcge, school parades at the weekend The famous Geisterzug, or \u201cghost parade\u201d, is held on Saturday evening - one week before Carnival. It\u2019s an alternative Carnival parade with political overtones that you can join spontaneously, as a figure of gloom or a brightly shining spirit. There\u2019s no need to register beforehand! The route changes every year, depending on the annual theme. It\u2019s been part of the Street Carnival in Cologne since 1991, but this tradition goes back even further, to 1860. Tulip Sunday features more school parades and Veedelsz\u00fcge (local parades) as well as more Carnival sessions with humorous speeches, singing and good cheer. If you think no one could possibly manage so much celebration, you\u2019ll be surprised: it\u2019s incredible how much enthusiasm Carnival generates in Cologne!

This carnival parade, which passes through Cologne city centre, is considered one of the largest parades in Germany. And being part of it is everything. The parade has been rolling since 1823 - with floats, foot groups, dance groups and music bands - led by the \"Blaue Funken\" in the Cologne tradition. With a length of around 8 kilometres, the Rosenmontag parade covers a larger distance than its route. Around 300 tonnes of sweets change the owner here in a perfect throwing technique - and around 300,000 \"Str\u00fc\u00dfjer\" (flowers) express their affection. The highlight and end of the parade are also certain: the moment when \"D'r Prinz k\u00fctt\" (\"The Prince arrives\"). Violet Tuesday : neighbourhood parades and burning the Nubbel On the last day of the Street Carnival, the biggest neighbourhood parades march through Nippes, Ehrenfeld and M\u00fclheim, with up to 200,000 enthusiastic spectators lining the sidewalks. The evening ceremony of burning the Nubbel, a scarecrow-like figure stuffed with straw, in front of many pubs marks the end of the \u201cfifth season\u201d. He\u2019s a scapegoat who takes all the excesses of the Carnival season with him as he burns down into ashes and restores the celebrants to a state of innocent forgetfulness. Isn\u2019t that lucky! Street Carnival facts and figures : did you know? As a social phenomenon and an economic factor, Carnival\u00a0means more than colorful costumes and joyful celebrations. For example, over 100 Carnival associations work together in the Cologne Carnival festival committee to organize the \u201ccrazy days\u201d of the Street Carnival. During an average parade, 330,000 kilogrammes of sweets, 700,000 chocolate bars and 220,000 boxes of pralines rain down on the enthusiastic spectators. K\u00f6lle alaaf! FAQ What is the theme for the 2026 carnival season? The theme of the 2026 Cologne Carnival season is \"ALAAF - Mer dun et f\u00f6r K\u00f6lle\" (ALAAF - We do it for Cologne). All information When does the Cologne street carnival begin? The street carnival begins on Weiberfastnacht (12 February 2026), which is the Thursday before Rose Monday (16 February 2026). There is a traditional cycle of sessions, balls and parades that takes place until Violet Tuesday (17 February 2026). The people celebrate, sing and dance in various halls, restaurants and pubs. During this time, normal life is suspended throughout Cologne. Many public institutions are closed, and Prince Carnival rules. The most important dates of the session What does one shout during carnival in Cologne? \u201cHelau\u201d or \u201cAlaaf\u201d? The Cologne cheer is \u201cK\u00f6lle Alaaf.\u201d \u201cHelau\u201d is the cheer in Mainz and D\u00fcsseldorf and thus is never used in Cologne under any circumstances. What does \u201cAlaaf\u201d mean? \u201cK\u00f6lle Alaaf\u201d is the cheer of the carnival revellers. It is derived from a medieval toast: \u201cAll ab\u201d (All-av). It more or less means \u201cCologne alone\u201d or \u201cCologne over everything.\u201d It\u2019s the shortest imaginable declaration of love to Cologne. Why does the \u201cNubbel\u201d get burned? The \u201cNubbel\u201d is a straw-filled doll that serves as the scapegoat for all of the transgressions that the revellers have committed during the days of carnival. The associated torchlight processions are held in the night from Violet Tuesday to Ash Wednesday . Impressive Nubbel burnings take place next to St. Agnes Church, in Nippes, in S\u00fcdstadt, in Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng and in the Old Town (Altstadt). What is a \"B\u00fctzje\"? B\u00fctzjer are friendly pecks on the cheek, and they have nothing to do with real kissing. A B\u00fctzje is not a silly attempt to flirt with you; during carnival it is part of the tradition and happens all the time. K \u00f6 ll e a l aa f ! Transcript",

The photographic documentation by the Brazilian photographer focuses on the Amazon region, the largest tropical rainforest region on our planet, and in particular on those people who have been in direct contact with their natural environment for generations. Around 200 masterful black and white photographs paint a vivid picture of landscapes and ways of life, while at the same time revealing the complexity of the interplay between nature and society. Salgado's approach is empathetic and reflective: Authentic interviews with indigenous leaders provide deep insights into the social realities and ecological challenges of the rainforest and its inhabitants. In an immersive staging, accompanied by a specially composed sound installation by French composer Jean-Michel Jarre, the show invites visitors to recognise the sensitive balance of the Amazon region anew and to critically question their own role in terms of global responsibility. Salgado's profound documentation thus calls for a holistic view that combines ecological awareness with ethical reflection.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking Gastronomy in Cologne Cuisine, drinking culture and going out \u2014 Cologne is casual in so many areas of life, and that\u2019s especially true when it comes to creature comforts. The city\u2019s brewery restaurants naturally have a long tradition in this regard. Cologne\u2019s typical brewery restaurant culture makes it uniquely sociable and unconventional \u2014 even outside the Carnival season. Cologne\u2019s vibrant restaurant scene has something to offer for every personality and every taste. It\u2019s energized by more than 1,000 different restaurants, over 100 bars, over 700 pubs and more than ten starred restaurants, as well as several food festivals and happenings. The bills of fare range from vegan to hearty, from home cooking to gourmet dining, and from K\u00f6lsch beer to creative cocktails. Taste it \u2014 and love it.

Some things don\u2019t change. And that\u2019s good news, especially with regard to Cologne\u2019s brewery restaurant culture. When the K\u00f6bes comes by with his round tray of K\u00f6lsch beer and the Sauerbrauten is steaming on the table, you know the city\u2019s traditions and history are alive and well. That\u2019s when things get snug and cosy, and that\u2019s how it ought to be.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking Brewery restaurants Drinking K\u00f6lsch , experiencing Cologne\u2019s conviviality \u201cIch bin ein K\u00f6lsch,\u201d said Bill Clinton after downing a glass of M\u00fchlen K\u00f6lsch beer and eating a dish of Rhineland-style Sauerbraten with dumplings and applesauce in 1999. That may be why the Rhineland-style Sauerbraten is still the front-runner here in Cologne\u2019s second-oldest brewery restaurant, the Brauerei zur Malzm\u00fchle. But there are many, many other options if you\u2019re looking for an extensive tour of brewery restaurants \u2014 with or without Sauerbraten and hearty traditional dishes such as \u201cHimmel un \u00c4d\u201d (Heaven and Earth), pork knuckle, and bratwurst. After all, Cologne is the only city that is permitted to brew its famous K\u00f6lsch beer. Top brewery restaurants Essentials of the brewery restaurant tour: the K\u00f6bes and the beer-coaster language There are so many brewery restaurants between the Cathedral, the Rathaus (Town Hall) and the Rhine Promenade that you\u2019ll surely be putting your beer coaster on top of your K\u00f6lsch glass before you\u2019ve gotten to know them all. With this gesture you\u2019ll be showing the K\u00f6bes that enough is enough. It\u2019s time to go home. What awaits you before you make this decision? Cologne\u2019s most down-to-earth restaurants, full of lively cheer and unique rustic charm. There\u2019s probably no other place where you can experience Cologne\u2019s typical hearty yet gruff hospitality as vividly as in its brewery restaurants, whether they\u2019re in the city centre or Cologne\u2019s traditional Altstadt (Old Town). Cologne & K\u00f6lsch : all about the only language you can drink You might be wondering how it feels to be amidst the brewery restaurant atmosphere. Here conversation flows easily, differences disappear and people simply have a good time and drink together, in line with the well-known local song \u201cDrink doch ene mit\u201d (lift a glass with us). You can choose between approximately 25 brands of K\u00f6lsch brewed in Cologne. Apropos K\u00f6lsch: Thanks to the special way it\u2019s brewed, this top-fermented beer makes better use of the sugar and malt than other types of beer, making it especially light and digestible. K\u00f6lsch is traditionally served by a waiter called a K\u00f6bes in the traditional gruff K\u00f6bes style \u2014 in a typical cylindrical K\u00f6lsch glass that holds 0.2 l. Because the glass is small, the K\u00f6bes rushes around with his round tray of glasses full of K\u00f6lsch, setting them down on customers\u2019 tables. The beer is drawn from a 10 L barrel, and it\u2019s always cool and fresh. So stop talking \u2014 and drink up! All about K\u00f6lsch and K\u00f6bes Speaking of the K\u00f6bes: in other places you might consider his behaviour rude, but here in Cologne\u2019s brewery restaurants it\u2019s part of the city\u2019s unique culture. You could call the K\u00f6bes an outlier in the polite art of serving that is normally practised in Germany. His traditional brewery worker\u2019s outfit consists of a blue knitted jacket with a high collar and a double row of black buttons, black trousers, a blue apron, and a leather pouch for money that is worn over his stomach. And his manner is part of the traditional brewery restaurant experience \u2014 it might be cheeky and rude, dry and deadpan, or then again hearty and cheerful. His changing moods might leave you either baffled or amused \u2014 it all depends on you. But there\u2019s one thing that never changes: in a brewery restaurant, the K\u00f6lsch tradition is king. Brewery restaurants in Cologne: unchanged for centuries Cologne\u2019s brewery restaurants can look back on a history that goes back for 500 years. In the year 1412, a decree of the magistrate of the city of Cologne established 21 breweries operated by professional guilds within the city walls. Cologne\u2019s oldest breweries include the Brauhaus Sion on Unter Taschenmacher, which first opened its doors in 1511, as well as the C\u00f6lner Hofbr\u00e4u P. Josef Fr\u00fch am Dom near the Cathedral and the Brauerei P\u00e4ffgen on the Friesenstra\u00dfe, both of which are more than 100 years old. Visitors who enjoy exploring historical cultures of food and drink will be interested in joining one of Cologne\u2019s guided brewery tours. The food critic J\u00fcrgen Dollase writes that the P\u00e4ffgen brewery restaurant, which offers \u201cclearly formulated prototypical Rhineland cuisine\u201d, brews its brand of Cologne\u2019s favourite beverage in its own cellar on the Friesenstra\u00dfe \u2014 and brings it directly to your table. The hearty fare that goes with it includes curly kale with smoked sausage, beer-marinaded pork knuckle, schnitzel, bratwurst and half a roast chicken with chips. And of course the brewery restaurants also serve K\u00f6lsch specialities such as Halver Hahn (a rye bread roll with aged Gouda cheese and mustard), Rhineland-style Sauerbraten and fried black pudding or liver sausage. Enjoy your meal! Breweries & modernism in Cologne: a footnote Today even the brewery-restaurant culture has a modern variant. For example, you can also find brewery restaurants without a K\u00f6bes or serving international or seasonal dishes \u2014 also including meatless dishes or even vegan goulash. Nowadays some brewery restaurants even serve Alt beer. But all of them still have something in common: traditional K\u00f6lsch hospitality. As the New York Times once put it in an article about Cologne\u2019s brewery-restaurant culture, \u201cBut drinking a K\u00f6lsch is more than just drinking a beer: it\u2019s like drinking an entire culture.\u201d Experience brewery culture live The top brewery restaurants at a glance Transcript",

It\u2019s time to go shopping at the weekly open-air market \u2014 which offers small delicacies at its street food stands and pleasant get-togethers after work. Cologne\u2019s Meet & Eat concept market combines a variety of urban ideas \u2014 and livens up the urban scene. It\u2019s surprising, meaningful and vital. When and where? Every Thursday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the Rudolfplatz behind the Hahnentorburg. This is a playground for the many foodies and people hungry for new experiences who enjoy this three-way market happening, which consists of a shopping experience, street & gourmet food and a weekly open-air market. Come join us! Unusually diverse, with excellent organic ratings Vietnamese spring rolls, Brussels waffles, Argentinian empanadas, vegan surprises and organic steaks \u2014 there are probably few other places where so many different dishes and national cuisines are gathered together in one small space. At this street food market in Cologne, you can find specialities from Italy, Peru, Brazil, Turkey, France and Austria as well as products from Spain, Asia, Tunisia and the Cologne region. Roofed-over benches and tables enable visitors to eat and drink in comfort in every kind of weather. Incidentally, in line with the basic concept, alcoholic drinks are served only in combination with food, snacks and prepared dishes. That\u2019s because here the idea of lively interactions in a marketplace has precedence over insobriety. So if you want a second K\u00f6lsch after your meal, you\u2019ll have to ask someone to bring it along for you. As a rule, alcoholic drinks can be ordered only together with food. Unconventional? Yes. Like the entire Meet & Eat market. Cologne\u2019s after-work market for working people The idea behind Meet & Eat was to create a positive response to modern social developments. Working people usually do their shopping in the afternoon or evening. No regular open-air market is open this late. Eating out will soon make up the same share of household spending as buying food to prepare at home. And an open and informal meeting point for pleasant interactions at the heart of the city is a permanent requirement for many Cologne residents anyhow.

Another aspect of Cologne\u2019s welcoming atmosphere is its friendly people and ample opportunities for communication \u2014 on the street, in the neighbourhoods or in a museum.

And it\u2019s one of Germany\u2019s top cities when it comes to restaurants and party venues. In Cologne you can expect to experience a unique and varied food and dining culture that\u2019s distributed across all of its neighbourhoods, ranging from K\u00f6lsch brewery restaurant culture with Rhineland Sauerbraten to temples of gourmet cuisine. Equally colourful are the events that enliven the city every year in connection with ColognePride . There are usually more than 100 events, during which the LGBTQIA+ community demonstrates its right to tolerance and peaceful coexistence. You may be wondering why this diversity is celebrated in Cologne in particular. It\u2019s probably because diversity is a genuine part of our city. Cologne is home to people from 180 different nations and a bastion of gay and lesbian life. About 9% of its residents have a disabled person\u2019s pass, and all of its age groups are growing at an equal pace. And because diversity is simply more fun. R estaurants From rustic to sensuous \u2014 from elegant to wood-panelled In more than 1,000 restaurants, Cologne\u2019s chefs have created a flourishing gourmet and connoisseurs\u2019 scene in this metropolis on the Rhine. The spectrum ranges from hearty dishes accompanied by a neat glass of K\u00f6lsch beer in one of Cologne\u2019s brewery restaurants or a local neighbourhood pub to multi-star restaurants, innovative tastings at food happenings and the little restaurant around the corner.

We\u2019re talking about Europe\u2019s biggest literature festival, which takes place in Cologne once a year: lit.COLOGNE. If you\u2019re looking for the emotions evoked when the intellectual world of literature and written culture is enlivened by in-person presence, lit.COLOGNE is the exciting framework where you can find them. Its events are held in unusual places and feature outstanding figures from the world of literature. Tip : The lit.COLOGNE spezial 2025 offers a literary highlight to kick off the book autumn. Three remarkable authors \u2013 Ocean Vuong, Caroline Wahl, and Susanne Abel \u2013 will present their latest works. The annual blockbuster event for all lovers of literature Every spring, up to 200 events attended by almost 100,000 visitors are held over a period of almost two weeks. During this time, lit.COLOGNE offers an extraordinary stage on which all lovers of culture and literature have a chance to encounter one of their favourite authors. You can look forward to an inspiring experience of the literature and themes you\u2019re interested in \u2014 at lit.COLOGNE. The programme is published and advance ticket sales begin in December every year lit.COLOGNE, the paradise for literature fans, is held in a variety of locations and interesting venues all over Cologne. There are many events that have been specially planned for the festival, ranging from theme-oriented evening events to readings, individual talks or portraits, and much more. If you want to meet outstanding nonfiction authors, exciting newcomers or Nobel Prize laureates working in varying genres live in Cologne, you\u2019ll have brilliant opportunities at lit.COLOGNE. The festival is always characterized by a wide spectrum of themes that cut through bestseller lists, mass media and high culture. Thanks to its status as an outstanding annual cultural event, lit.COLOGNE has collected numerous awards in recent years. For example, a gala event at the WDR-Funkhaus radio hall opens lit.COLOGNE with the presentation of the German Audiobook Prize. The annual programme for the coming year\u2019s event is presented at the beginning of December, and ticket sales also begin at that time. The organizers thoughtfully cater to visitors\u2019 needs. Since 2013, many of the events have been barrier-free. Sign language interpreters, as well as induction loops for hearing aid users, are provided. For children and young people, lit.COLOGNE offers lit.kid.COLOGNE Enjoy lit.COLOGNE with the whole family! From the very start, the festival has included a special area designed in detail for kids and teenagers, starting with preschoolers and primary school-age children. The readings are held in immersive venues that bring books together with a real-life environment. The aim is to give young eyes and ears a special experience! There are also readings of great books for school classes. One figure alone shows that the organizers are seriously committed to the idea of making literature fun for a younger audience: in 2022, 78 of the total of 179 events were designed for children and teenagers. All information: lit.kid.COLOGNE Offshoots of lit.COLOGNE: lit.COLOGNE Special, phil.cologne & lit.Ruhr Since 2011, lit.COLOGNE Special has been held simultaneously with the Frankfurt Book Fair, thus providing an additional literature festival in the autumn. Another offshoot of lit.COLOGNE, a philosophy festival known as phil.COLOGNE , has been held since 2013. By presenting philosophical dialogues and related events, it offers a broad audience access to philosophy and its real-life themes in a non-university setting. Another event organized by lit.COLOGNE is lit.RUHR , which has been held in the Ruhr region since 2017. Its main venue is the Zollverein coal mine industrial complex in Essen. Like lit.COLOGNE, this festival also offers a programme for children and teenagers: lit.kid.RUHR. New format at lit.COLOGNE: lit.COLOGNE POP - all forms of art and culture lit.COLOGNE POP takes a special role within lit.COLOGNE and, as an independent platform, is addressed primarily to the younger audience. Its programme covers all kinds of forms of culture: discourse, literature, music, theatre, film, analogue encounters that reflect current topics, topics that influence us, that trigger and move us - over two days. The lit.COLOGNE POP will end with a club night. About the history of lit.COLOGNE, held in Cologne since 2001 The concept behind lit.COLOGNE was born in 2000 against the background of the organizers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the way literature was being presented back then. Readings held in bookstores were only attracting small audiences. The organizers felt that book lovers should be able to look forward to a richer experience and a more stimulating atmosphere for encountering authors. A new model was offered by the film, music and theatre scene. The organizers decided to add professional presenters and translators to the mix and to showcase dialogue-oriented literary events more substantively as communicative encounters. Incidentally, lit.COLOGNE was included in the Guinness Book of Records in 2006 for organizing the world\u2019s biggest German lesson \u2014 an event that was held in the sold-out Lanxess Arena.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking PDF Share Stunksitzung Tip Custom\/culture Since 1984 there\u2019s been a cabaret-style alternative programme for celebrating Carnival In recent years, the Stunksitzung has featured \u201cThe rat and the mouse\u201d, i.e. the Pope in bed with a cardinal; a sketch in which Bishop Walter Mixa describes Pope Benedict XVI as \u201cthe Lord\u2019s weasel, as dumb as a roll of communion wafers\u201d; and a crucifix labelled \u201cT\u00fcnnes\u201d (a traditional figure of fun in Cologne). Is this your kind of irreverent humour? If so, we recommend this alternative Carnival programme, because the Stunksitzung\u2019s mockery of current social and political topics has lost none of its sharp satirical bite over the years. Definitely not a traditional \u201cPrunksitzung\u201d: the thinking man\u2019s Carnival revue The Stunksitzung is an antidote to political correctness, and its impudence is legendary. It\u2019s a cabaret show that\u2019s the direct opposite of the numerous \u201cPrunksitzungen\u201d held during Carnival. Both kinds of events are fixed components of Cologne\u2019s \u201cfifth season\u201d. If you\u2019re not keen on the swaying and jollity of the traditional \u201cPrunksitzungen\u201d and prefer the kind of alternative entertainment that satirizes politicians, the German army, the Catholic Church and the Carnival associations such as the Rote Funken, the Stunksitzung belongs on your Carnival agenda. Be sure to buy your ticket well ahead of time and enjoy one of the many Stunksitzung performances during the months before the Street Carnival and pub Carnival\u00a0 begin. The Stunksitzung ensemble: an alternative tradition The Stunksitzung ensemble was founded in 1983 and held its first session in 1984 \u2014 and many members of the original ensemble are still active today. The president of this event until 1995 was its co-founder J\u00fcrgen Becker, a renowned German cabaret artist also known as \u201cHeinz the Iroquois\u201d. He was succeeded by Biggi Wanninger in 1999. The house band that has played at the Stunksitzung since 1988 is the K\u00f6bes Underground. And since 1991 the event\u2019s venue, to which the fans flock, has been the E-Werk in Cologne-M\u00fclheim. Biting, ironic, critical: beyond old-fashioned jokes and marching-band music The programme takes jabs at international politics and dislikeable characters all over the globe, and it features typically sharp local sketches and artistic numbers. If you like to laugh and enjoy seeing comedians taking swipes at Cologne\u2019s Carnival and its traditional programme, come to the Stunksitzung \u2014 there won\u2019t be a dry eye in the house.

Events Sights Gastronomy Bike tours K\u00f6lnCard Booking PDF Share Tourist Information Cologne Tourist information A premier address for guests from all over the world. Since 1955. It is said: from here you have the best view of the Cologne Cathedral. This was already true in 1955 when the building of the Tourist Information Cologne was constructed as the \u201cHouse of Tourism\u201d and it still applies today: after extensive modernization and more digitalization in guest consultations. We look forward welcoming you to Cologne and providing you with all the information you need \u2013 on sights, events, as well as culinary offerings and personal tips for your stay. The modern concept integrates contemporary informational habits with the stylistic charm of the '50s. Thus, listed elements stand alongside digital stations, conversation islands, and touchscreens as complements or alternatives to personal consultations and service in multiple languages. A cozy book and reading corner invites you to stay and browse before you head upstairs via the original '50s curved staircase to the \u201cbalcony with a view\u201d where you also find the inspirational gift shop. From Touchscreen to Your Own Smartphone \u2013 or Analog Through a large interactive map or via one of the touchscreens at the counters, you can browse various route suggestions or use the experience planner for sights, events, dining tips, or hotels in the foyer. Everything can be transferred to your smartphone via QR code \u2013 for when you're on the go. This also works with regard to personal consultations at the counters. You can find answers to frequently asked questions about your stay in Cologne, such as \u201cWhere can I charge my phone?\u201d in the FAQ \u2013 with various informational materials available classically in print on-site or as PDF for download. Centrally Located and Welcoming: Including Souvenir Shop on the 1st Floor with a View of the Cathedral Conveniently located in close proximity to the main train station , Cologne Cathedral , Hohe Strasse , and the old town , the Tourist Information at Kardinal-H\u00f6ffner-Platz 1 offers you a perfect start for your visit: Get inspired here for your exciting stay in Cologne. But before you put your Cologne plans into action, don\u2019t forget to take in the view from the window on the 1st floor of the main portal of the Cathedral. This is also where the CologneShop is located with Cologne souvenirs, brand, fan, and decorative items, as well as many accessories. A Little Journey Back to the Tourism of the '50s... Not only because of its listed architecture and interior design with mosaic columns, wall murals, and staircase does the Tourist Information stand as an exemplar of the '50s. As an institution it also reminds you of the years of progress and economic boom. After the austere post-war years, in the '50s and with the advent of the economic miracle, Germans slowly rediscovered their wanderlust: Dolce Vita instead of drudge work, guesthouses, and guest rooms instead of staying home. Besides tours on foot, by bike, or train to the seaside or the Black Forest, many people also returned to the Rhine metropolis of Cologne. The first point of contact was often just this house of tourism with its three golden crowns on the bay window \u2013 symbolically for the Three Wise Men, whose relics rest directly opposite in Cologne Cathedral. A lovely symbolic connection, don\u2019t you think? House of Tourism from 1955 The building was erected in 1955 following the plans of the renowned Cologne architect Hans Joachim Lohmeyer, who was significantly involved in the city's reconstruction. The factual, simple facade, and functional design is typical of the 1950s architecture, as these buildings could be efficiently constructed and flexibly used for various offices. The old \u201ctraffic office\u201d with its tourism department was destroyed in the war. The latest modernization with its new interior reminiscent of the 1950s has made the building not only touristic but also energetically fit for the future \u2013 everywhere if possible, in consideration of existing monument protection regulations.
