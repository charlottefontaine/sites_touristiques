The huge legendary sculpture has a diameter of 1.75 meters and is dedicated to the God of the Sea, represented by a male bearded face with holes for the eyes, nose and mouth . According to legend A husband who mistrusted his wife took her to the Mouth of Truth to test her faithfulness . The woman reacted by pretending to swoon and her lover caught her in his arms. After this, the woman swore before the Mouth of Truth that she had only been in the arms of her husband and of the man that had just caught her. This is just one of the many legends that exist regarding the famous sculpture that, with the passing of time, continues to generate enormous anticipation . Where is the Mouth of Truth? The sculpture was once located in the Piazza della Bocca della Verit\u00e1 until 1632. It was then\u00a0transferred to the outside of one of the walls of the nearby Santa Mar\u00eda in Cosmedin , the place where it remains today. It is very common to see large numbers of people lining up to be photographed with their hand inside the Mouth of Truth.

Book Tour The Capitoline Museums (Musei Capitolini) are found in Piazza del Campidoglio . The museums are owned and administered by the Municipality of Rome. The museum was\u00a0the result of the donation of a collection of valuable bronzes by Pope Sixtus IV in 1471 to the citizens of Rome, making them the oldest museums in the world. The museums are made up of two imposing buildings: the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the Palazzo Nuovo. Both mansions are linked by the Galleria Lapidaria, a tunnel that takes you under Piazza del Campidoglio without having to leave the museums. Palazzo dei Conservatori Opened to the public in 1734 under Pope Clement XII, the Palazzo dei Conservatori houses a collection including paintings, sculptures, busts of well-known people of that time, and other artwork by renowned artists like Caravaggio, Tiziano, Rubens, and Tintoretto. One of the main attractions found in this museum is the original sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf. The mansion also features the Ritratto di Carlo I d'Angi\u00f2 de Arnolfo di Cambio (1277), the first sculpture of a living person. One of the most striking parts of the building is a glass-covered hall. In the center is the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, originally displayed in the Piazza del Campidoglio. In this wing, fragments of several colossal statues are preserved. Palazzo Nuovo The Palazzo Nuovo is devoted primarily to the exhibition of statues, sculptures, mosaics, and busts. Some of these are Roman replicas of Greek originals. Among the museum\u2019s greatest works is the Capitoline Venus, a marble sculpture designed between 100 and 150 AD. Other famous works of art include the Discobolus and the statue of Dying Gaul. In the Hall of the Philosophers, visitors will find remarkable busts of Greek and Roman philosophers. These portraits had previously decorated the gardens and villas of the Roman aristocrats. Worth exploring Located in the heart of the city, the two palaces that make up the Capitoline Museums offer an impressive collection of Roman paintings and sculptures, leaving visitors speechless.

Learn the myth behind this tradition and learn about its history . Book your tour Trevi Fountain is the most beautiful fountain in Rome . Measuring some 20 meters in width by 26 meters in height, Trevi Fountain is also the largest fountain in the city . The origins of the fountain go back to the year 19 B.C., in which period the fountain formed the end of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct . The first fountain was built during the Renaissance, under the direction of Pope Nicholas V. The final appearance of the Trevi Fountain dates from 1762, when\u00a0after many years of works at the hand of Nicola Salvi, it was finalized by Giuseppe Pannini. Interestingly enough, the name of Trevi derives from Tre Vie (three ways) , since the fountain was the meeting point of three streets. The myth of the Trevi Fountain Why are there always people in the fountain throwing coins into the water and taking photos of themselves? The myth, originating in 1954 with the movie \" Three Coins in the Fountain ,\" goes like this: If you throw one coin: you will return to Rome . If you throw two coins: you will fall in love with an attractive Italian. If you throw three coins: you will marry the person that you met. In order to achieve the desired effect, you should throw the coin with your right hand over your left shoulder. An interesting statistic is that approximately a million euros worth of coins are taken from the fountain each year . Since 2007 this money has been used to support good causes . The most beautiful fountain in the world For us Trevi Fountain is the most beautiful fountain in the world . Whether under daylight or warmly lit up at night, the fountain is never lonely. One thing that can dampen the mood is that the area is full of people trying to sell roses in a pushy way, but simply ignoring them is enough to be able to continue enjoying such a special place.

        "text":"Piazza Navona - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Piazzas and fountains Piazza Navona Defined during the fifteenth century, the Baroque-style Piazza Navona is one of the most charming and popular squares in Rome . The public square is built on the site where the Stadium of Domitian (Circus Agonalis), founded in 86 AD,\u00a0once stood. It could hold approximately 20,000 spectators, which came here to see different athletic competitions. Fountains of Piazza Navona The most beautiful parts of Piazza Navona are its three fountains, designed during the papacy of Gregory XIII : Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Erected in the centre of Piazza Navona, the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers) was designed by Bernini in 1651 . The four statues represent the most important rivers of the continents where Christianity had spread; the Nile, Danube, the Ganges and Rio de la Plata. In the middle there is an obelisk measuring 52 ft (16 m), which had originally been part of the Circus of Maxentius, found in the Appian Way Regional Park. Fontana del Moro Sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and later perfected by Bernini, who added the figure of the Moor, the fountain was initially called the \u201cSeashell Fountain.\u201d This fountain is located on the southern side of the square. Fontana del Nettuno The Fontana del Nettuno (Fountain of Neptune) was also created by Giacomo della Porta in 1574 , but remained unfinished for approximately three-hundred years, until 1878, when it was decorated by Antonio Della Bitta and Gregorio Zappal\u00e0. Interesting facts Until mid-nineteenth century, every summer the drains of the three fountains were blocked and the centre of the square was flooded to make the \u201cLake of Piazza Navona\u201d . It was greatly enjoyed by the locals. A charming area The square is surrounded by restaurants and terraces giving Piazza Navona a lively and delightful atmosphere during the day. Here, visitors can enjoy performances by street artists like magicians and dancers. The most imposing buildings which look onto the square are the Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone and the Palazzo Pamphilj.

        "text":"Our Lady of the Conception - The Crypt of the Capuchins, Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Our Lady of the Conception Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins (Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini), erected between 1626 and 1631, was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII. It is one of the most uncommon churches in Rome thanks to its unusual crypt. Interior The interior of this small church stands out because of its bare walls and discreet decoration, which contrasts greatly with the majority of the temples in Rome and their ostentatious ornaments. However, this is not what makes it so special. The main appeal of Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins is found in the church\u2019s crypt, where many visitors will feel a chill down their spines as soon as they walk down to the ossuary. The Capuchin Crypt After the church was finished in 1631, Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin friars, ordered that the remains of the members of his order be moved from the cemetery to the church\u2019s crypt. The bones were to be placed on the walls in a specific way, creating different motifs and designs full of religious symbolism, a site where the friars would come to reflect and pray. The crypt is divided into six pocket-sized chapels, decorated with the bones of 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870. The effect is as shocking as it is macabre. As well as the walls covered in individual bones, the chapels also house truly chilling\u00a0whole skeletons dressed with the Capuchin brown habit. Despite what it might seem, the ossuary is an imaginative cult for the dead, which\u00a0only seeks to demonstrate that the body merely contains the soul. Very popular The church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini is usually unnoticed by the crowds of tourists who seek to explore the macabre crypt and its d\u00e9cor of skeletons. Although this is a very unusual and unforgettable experience, it might\u00a0be unsuitable for overly sensitive people.

        "text":"Film and TV in Rome - Famous tv shows and films Civitatis Rome General Information Film and TV in Rome Thanks to its long history , reflected in its present, Rome has been one of the most-filmed cities in the world throughout the years.

Films and TV Series Set in Rome Roman Holiday: As you might guess by the title, you can explore pretty much every scene in the film, just by passing through the city. Directed by William\u00a0Wyler and with lead acting by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck ,\u00a0it includes the Mouth of Truth in one of the most iconic scenes in classic cinema.

La dolce vita: Without a doubt an Italian, and Roman, classic. Federico Fellini's masterwork paints a picture of the social life of the time, and invites you to dive into the Trevi fountain , just like its protagonists! To Rome With Love: This 2012 film from the acclaimed Woody Allen, was filmed throughout the eternal city, and through its adventures takes in the Altare della Patria and the Baths of Caracalla . Gladiator: The winner of five Oscars , including best film and best actor for its protagonist, Russell Crowe\u2014this modern great, directed by Ridley Scott , includes stunning recreations of some of Rome's monuments and attractions including the Colosseum in its heyday.

        "text":"Baths of Caracalla - Opening hours, tickets and location - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Baths of Caracalla Situated near the Appian Way, the Baths of Caracalla are one of the largest and most impressive thermae built in antiquity in Rome. Book your tour Built between the years 212 and 216 under the direction of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, more commonly known as Emperor Caracalla, the Baths of Caracalla were one of the greatest and most spectacular thermal complexes in ancient times. In spite of the fact that today only the brick walls and large collapsed vaults remain, the remnant of the splendour of the Baths of Caracalla is still preserved. The splendour of the baths Going to the baths was a favourite pastime of the Romans, who visited them regularly both to maintain their hygiene and to improve their social relations. In the vast precinct that held the baths, the citizens could not only use the public baths but also dedicate their time to doing exercise, visiting the library, walking through the gardens or worshipping\u00a0the god Mithras and other pagan divinities by visiting the temple. The baths make up an architectural wonder when you keep in mind the date of their construction since they include effective water supply systems, as well as heating and drainage systems. The wood-fired ovens that were fed by the slaves served to heat the floors and walls of the baths, in addition to the water. Covered with marble and decorated with valued works of art, the Baths of Caracalla were the most sumptuous baths to be built in ancient times. Although subsequently they were surpassed in size by the Baths of Diocletian , these were not capable of matching their splendour. After remaining in operation for more than three hundred years, the baths were closed by necessity in the year 537, when the aqueducts that supplied water to the city were destroyed by the barbarians. The sculptures and valuable materials that decorated the baths were plundered and subsequently, in the year 847, an earthquake shook the building and destroyed part of it. The baths today In spite of the passing of centuries and of the lootings that the baths suffered, the ground floor of the buildings and a large part of the impressive walls that formed the precinct remain. By using your imagination it is possible to submerge yourself in the splendour of ages past.

        "text":"What to See in Rome in 3 Days - What to see in Rome in 3 days Civitatis Rome What to See in Rome in 3 Days Although the city is ideally seen in 4 or more days, sometimes visitors have only a weekend to see Rome . To make the most of your visit, check out our top tips for what to see\u00a0in Rome in 3 days, including stops at the Vatican City! Arrival: Squares and Fountains By the time you\u2019ve landed, found your hotel, and dropped your luggage off, there will probably not be enough time to visit any monuments. What should you do? The best plan is to take a walk through the city center and get to know its streets, squares (piazzas), and fountains. If you want to arrive at your hotel without any complications and as quickly as possible, we recommend checking out our transfer service from the airport in Rome to your hotel . If you'd prefer to save on this journey to the hotel, you can also get a bus for a good price: Buy tickets for the shuttle bus from Ciampino Airport to Rome . If your accommodation is in the outskirts, the best way to get to Piazza di Spagna is to get the metro (line A). If you\u2019re staying in the city center, it might be a better idea to go on foot. Once in Piazza di Spagna, take the Via dei Condotti, one of the city\u2019s most important high streets, until you get to the Via del Corso. Here, turn left. Walk down the street and cross the Piazza Colonna (where the Column of Marcus Aurelius is located). Two streets further down, turn to the left and take the Via delle Muratte. Walk a few meters until you are hit by a breathtaking sight: the Trevi Fountain . This is a great place to stop and enjoy the beauty of such a monument. If you are superstitious, you might want to throw a coin into the fountain. Walking back down Via delle Muratte, cross Via del Corso, and continue along Via di Pietra. Five minutes later, you\u2019ll arrive at the Pantheon , the best-preserved monument from the Roman Empire. If you\u2019d like to enjoy the views, you can order a cappuccino in one of the many terraces of the piazza. Leave the Pantheon via Salita de Crescenzi Street and follow the signs until you get to Piazza Navona . This impressive square houses the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the Fontana del Moro, and the Fountain of Neptune, as well as the Obelisk of Domitian. Exit the square from the south side (by the Fontana del Moro) and you\u2019ll arrive at Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a wider street. If you head down this street, on the left side, you\u2019ll come across the Area Sacra dell\u2019Argentina , an excavation where you\u2019ll be able to see the remains of Roman architecture from the Roman Republic. This area is especially beautiful when lit up. Continuing in the same direction you'll see the Monument to Victor Emmanuel II , a huge building built in honor of the first king of Italy. If you have time to spare, you can go and see the Piazza del Campidoglio . Choose a restaurant nearby and if you\u2019re not too tired you can go and have a drink at Campo dei Fiori , one of Rome\u2019s liveliest squares. If you'd like to explore with a guide on your first day in Rome, we recommend booking this night tour of Rome . Day 2: The Vatican City If you\u2019re visiting Rome during the weekend, you should dedicate the first day, Saturday, to explore the Vatican City and\u00a0its museums , since on Sundays the Vatican Museums are closed (apart from the last Sunday of each month). If you're only in Rome for 2 or 3 days, you should probably expect to wake up early.\u00a0To make the most of your time in Rome, you should make it to the Vatican City no later than 9 am. The best way to get to the Citt\u00e0 Vaticano is to take the metro to Ottaviano. Upon leaving the station, take the street with the same name until you arrive at St. Peter's Square . After having taken in the splendid views of St Peter\u2019s Square, join the queue to enter St Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the holiest temples for Christendom. Inside the Basilica, it's definitely worth climbing to the top of the dome (446 ft - 136 m tall) to get a bird\u2019s eye view of Rome and the Vatican City. The ascent is a little exhausting (especially if you choose the stairs), but it's also part of its appeal. When you come down from the dome you'll have to leave St. Peter's Square and follow the signs to get to the Vatican Museums. If you are lucky there won't be a long queue and you'll be able to enter more or less directly. If you like museums you can stay for hours or days, but remember\u00a0at the end of the museum\u00a0is Michelangelo's masterpiece: The Sistine Chapel . If you want to visit the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel without the long queues, we recommend this Vatican City guided tour . If you also want to enjoy the impressive St Peter's Basilica, you can opt for this more complete option: Tour with access to the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums and St Peter's Basilica . On finishing your visit to the Vatican, take Via della Conciliazione from St. Peter's Square. On this street is located the Castel Sant'Angelo (Castle of the Holy Angel) and the bridge, Ponte Sant\u2019Angelo, a Roman bridge that is considered one of the most beautiful ones in Rome. The castle is now a museum, definitely worth exploring. We also recommend checking out this Castel Sant'Angelo tour (with Terrace Access included) . Cross the bridge and follow the signs to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon , which you can visit. If there are still some hours of daylight and you wish to relax a bit, head to Villa Borghese , one of Rome\u2019s most romantic public parks. Here you can lie on the grass or go for a stroll and discover its lake and numerous buildings. If you\u2019re traveling with children, they will love this green space. Borghese Gallery guided tour At night there is nothing better than to wander\u00a0through the city streets taking in Rome\u2019s lively atmosphere and extraordinary architecture. If you didn\u2019t have time to visit Campo dei Fiori the previous day, why not go today and have a relaxing drink? Day 3: Imperial Rome If you enjoy history you'll have left the best for the last day, since today we shall visit the Roman Forum , the Palatine Hill , and the Colosseum . As soon as you leave the station you'll have before you the great wonder of ancient Rome: the Colosseum . If you find a long queue at the Colosseum (more than 15 minutes) you can\u00a0visit the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill first. The entrance fee is shared and you can then return to the Colosseum without waiting in line. To enjoy this experience to the max without long queues, we recommend booking the most popular guided tour in Rome: Guided tour of the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill . After finishing these visits you can access Capitoline Hill from the north side of the forum. When you get to Piazza del Campidoglio don't miss the statue of Romulus and Remus , located just before entering the square and often missed due to its location. Take the \u201cCordonata\u201d stairs that lead\u00a0to Via del Teatro Marcello and stay on the left side of the street. In less than 10 minutes you'll get to Santa Mar\u00eda in Cosmedin, where the Mouth of Truth is found. Once you\u2019ve visited the church, cross the river Tiber and you\u2019ll find yourself in Trastevere , one of Rome\u2019s most charming neighborhoods. The atmosphere is very lively and the restaurants are good quality and have very affordable prices. You can finish by having an ice cream in Santa Maria in Trastevere Square. If your flight doesn\u2019t leave until late, we recommend going to the ruins of the Circus Maximus or the Baths of Caracalla . If you want to enjoy the city to the fullest but prefer not to do it on foot, the Rome tourist bus is the ideal option to visit the main places of interest in complete comfort. Staying in Rome for more than 3 days? If you\u2019ve already done our 3-day Rome itinerary and you've got more time, why not check out our list of the most important museums or\u00a0catacombs?

        "text":"Things to Do in Rome - Top Attractions in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to Do in Rome Explore Rome's most impressive squares, fountains, monuments and attractions. Rome is a breath-taking open-air museum and these are its top sights. Millennia of history, unbeatable cuisine, and much more, Rome is rightfully one of the most popular tourist destinations on the planet . With so many things to do and see in Rome, one of the most difficult parts of visiting the Eternal City can be crafting the perfect itinerary. Read on to discover our must-dos! 1. Visit the Colosseum An ever-enduring symbol of the grandeur of Ancient Rome, the Colosseum is perhaps one of the most recognizable landmarks on the planet, as well as one of the 7 Wonders of the World. This breathtaking amphitheater is right in the heart of the city, and once would have accommodated as many as 80,000 spectators. These giant crowds would watch on as the venue played host to everything from epic gladiator fights to public executions. With Civitatis, there are lots of different ways of visiting this bucket list landmark. You don\u2019t need a guide to visit the Colosseum. However, to get the full experience, and to gain a deeper insight into the landmark\u2019s history, we recommend taking this guided tour of the Colosseum , which includes a pass for the gladiator's entrance, meaning you'll get to walk where so many gladiators would have emerged into the arena, to the roar of up to 80,000 Romans cheering.

        "text":"National Roman Museum - Palazzo Massimo alle Terme Civitatis Rome Things to do Museums and Art Galleries National Roman Museum One of the top attractions in Rome is the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, one of the four parts of the Museo Nazionale Romano. The National Roman Museum is located in four different buildings; the Baths of Diocletian , the Palazzo Altemps , the Crypta Balbi and lastly, the Palazzo Massimo . This last palace features one of the best archaeological and classical art collections in the world. The Palazzo Massimo is also called Palazzo Massimo alle Terme due to its close proximity to the Baths pf Diocletian. The villa is a superb Neo-Renaissance-style palace, erected between 1883 and 1887. It was used as a Jesuit college until 1960 and in 1981 it was transformed into part of the National Roman Museum. Exhibitions The various exhibitions of the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme are divided into different themes and organized chronologically throughout the four floors of the museum. The basement houses a collection of jewels, grave ornaments and Roman coins from different periods. This might be considered to be\u00a0the least interesting floor of the museum. The ground and first-floor feature famous\u00a0Greek and Roman sculptures and statues, as well as impressive sarcophagi\u00a0and high reliefs. The second floor\u00a0showcases the best preserved Roman frescoes in the world, which are considered the highlight of the museum. Originally located in the Villa of Livia and Villa Farnesina , these colourful frescoes, sometimes covering an entire room, represent different paradisiacal landscapes and domestic life. On the same floor, visitors will also see an impressive collection of mosaics from the second and fourth century AD. Well worth visiting After visiting the Borghese Gallery and Capitoline Museums , we recommend going to Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.

Book this guided tour Roman circuses were the most important centres of entertainment in the Roman cities, apart from the theatres and amphitheatres. They were extended precincts in which the public games were held , consisting of chariot races and different spectacles. The Circus Maximus in Rome (Circo Massimo), located between the Aventino and Palatine Hills, was an extended precinct with space for 300,000 spectators . The arena, which measured 600 meters in length and 225 meters in width, made the Circus Maximus the largest in Rome, ahead of the Circus of Flaminius and the Circus of Maxentius. Celebrations in the Circus Maximus In the Circus Maximus several competitions were carried out, standing out among them chariot races , in which participants tried to complete seven laps of the Circus Maximus. The competitors , mounted in small chariots drawn by horses, gambled much more than their prestige or large prizes in the races, since many of them were slaves fighting for their liberty . During the public games, equestrian exhibitions , known as \"Ludus Troiae\", also took place. These were a simulation of various famous battles carried out by young Roman aristocrats. There were also foot races that lasted for several hours. The spectators would bet on the winners, making the competitions even more exciting. The importance of using your imagination Currently, the ruins of what was once the Circus Maximus barely remain. There is only the enormous terrace that keeps the form that it had in its day, which often causes disappointment for tourists who visit it hoping to find at least the ruins of the precinct.

R - It is possible to book a private transfer service in Rome with a minimum of 8 hours in advance P - How long does the journey from the hotel to the airport take? R - If you book round-trip transfers, we recommend requesting pickup from your hotel 2.5 hours before your flight . The drive to Ciampino takes about 30 minutes, and around 40 minutes to Fiumicino. Good to know Please take care during the transfer and help keep the vehicle clean. Otherwise, the provider may apply an additional cleaning fee. P - What pick up time should I choose? R - For transfers beginning at the airport, you should indicate the time at which your flight is due to arrive. The same goes for cruise ports and train stations: you should indicate the planned arrival time. For transfers from your hotel, you should indicate when you would like to be picked up. That doesn't mean the flight time, rather the time you would like to be collected. For shared transfers, orders may be modified by the provider. Should this be the case, we will contact you to confirm the rearranged time. P - How long will the driver wait for me? R - Airports: 1 hour from the plane's arrival\u00a0time. Cruise ports:\u00a030 minutes from the time indicated when making your reservation. Tran stations: 15 minutes from the train's arrival time. Hotels and apartments: 15 minutes from the time indicated when making your reservation. If for any reason you need more time, please ring the telephone number on your reservation. Should this be the case, supplements may apply. P - Where will the driver be waiting for me? R - Airports: Meet&Greet transfer included : the driver will wait at the nearest available pickup point to the exit of the baggage claim area. Meet&Greet transfer not included : we'll email you the directions to the meeting point and\/or the driver will indicate it before the service. Ports : the driver will wait in the arrivals terminal. Train stations : the driver will wait at the exit of the train's arrival platform. Hotels and apartments :\u00a0the driver will wait outside the building. If it's possible to park, the driver may wait at reception. P - Are the prices final? Are there any extra charges? R - Unlike our competitors, our prices are final, and include all fees, including tolls and tips. Some extra charges may apply if the destination is not as arranged, or if an extra stop must be taken on the way. P - How many people can travel in the vehicle? R - The number of seats indicated for each vehicle is the maximum number of people who can travel, excluding the driver. All passengers, including small children no matter the age, count. If your group is large, you should reserve more than one vehicle. P - How many suitcases can I take? R - During the reservations process you can see the amount of luggage that each vehicle allows. Each vehicle comes with indications as to its maximum capacity for large suitcases and hand luggage. The maximum dimensions per type of suitcase are: Hand luggage: total length, height and width\u00a0adding up to no more than 115 cm. Large suitcase:\u00a0total length, height and width adding up to no more than 155 cm. P - Are child seats available? R - During the reservation process you'll see information regarding child seats. Depending on the regulations in each destination, these may be obligatory or optional, and they may be free or imply an additional cost. You will see this cost added before booking. P - How can I find out my flight number? R - The flight number is comprised of 2 characters that represent the airline, and 4 numbers for the flight number. Some examples are IB3506, UX1254, or 5Z1826. You can find your flight number on the airline's confirmation email. P - Do I have to let someone know if my flight, boat, or train is delayed? R - Flights, trains and boats are constantly monitored, so you don't have to worry about getting in touch with us. Should the delay be large, if it's impossible to reprogram the transfer as there are no vehicles available, we'll refund the full amount paid. P - Why do I need a working mobile phone? R - A working mobile phone is needed so we can call you should there be any emergency, such as a breakdown, or simply if the driver can't find you. P - Who is responsible for a missed flight? R - The transfer company is never responsible for a missed flight. The clients are those who must know what time the flight leaves, and book pick up far enough ahead of time. P - Is it possible to make various stops? R - If you're staying in different hotels, or you need to make a stop to pick up keys, this service comes with supplemental charges. Once you have made your reservation, we'll send you an email with the amount. You can accept or cancel the service at no cost. You can pay online or in-destination. P - Can I share the vehicle with other people? R - We offer both private and shared transfers. In the case of private services, the vehicle will be for you alone. For shared transfers, you will share the vehicle with other passengers. P - Will the driver speak English? R - Although in the majority of countries, the drivers will speak several languages, we can't guarantee that the driver assigned to you will speak English. Nonetheless, it shouldn't be necessary to complete the transfer, as the driver will have all the necessary details. P - Do you have transfers in other destinations? R - Yes, here you can see all the destinations where we offer airport transfers .

Our flight was delayed by over an hour, I sent a message to the provider (just to be sure, because they had the flight number too) and they replied saying everything was fine, and when we arrived, the transfer was waiting for us!

Repasamos todos los dem\u00e1s meeting point que hab\u00eda y mi nombre no estaba. Estuvimos una media hora busc\u00e1ndolo, de un sitio a otro. Al final lo encontramos en otro meeting point, en el que anteriormente ya hab\u00edamos mirado. Con todo el agobio de gente, fue una experiencia desagradable. Pero luego el conductor fue muy amable y estuvo haci\u00e9ndonos un peque\u00f1o tour por la ciudad. I travelled with my partner Al ser un traslado compartido el conductor estaba en otra terminal a la espera de pasajeros que llegaban en un vuelo anterior.

However, our flight landed at 8:30 and we didn\u2019t get in the car until 9:15. The only reason I didn\u2019t just hop in a taxi is because I already booked the transfer. Called the company and was able to speak to someone that told me the driver was on the way which was helpful. Would be nice if they had arrived on time seeing that they tell you you\u2019ll be charged an extra fee if you\u2019re an hour late. I travelled with friends This was a shared transfer, so the trip does not start until the driver picks up every passenger. \ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce 10 \ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce\ue9ce 05 \/ 12 \/ 2019 J Jo\u00e3o Luiz Amazonas Pimp\u00e3o Curitiba, Brazil Apesar do atraso no v\u00f4o e da demora para os tr\u00e2mites de entrada no pa\u00eds, espera da bagagem e chegar ao ponto de encontro, o motorista da Civitatis estava nos aguardando pacientemente mesmo ap\u00f3s decorrido um hor\u00e1rio maior do que normalmente a empresa se comprometeu a nos esperar.

The gallery features an important part of the collection begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (nephew of Pope Paul V), between 1576 and 1633. As well as an avid art collector of Caravaggio\u2019s works, the Cardinal was Bernini\u2019s first sponsor. Thus, the museum has an extensive collection of both artists. Exhibitions The exhibitions are found on the mansion\u2019s bottom and top floor. The first floor houses works of art by renowned artists such as Tiziano, Raphael, Caravaggio, Rubens and Botticelli. The ground floor is dedicated to classic antiquities from the first to the third centuries AD.

        "text":"Rome Metro - Lines, hours, fares and Rome metro maps Civitatis Rome Public Transport Rome Metro The Metro of Rome only has three lines and is currently the smallest metro system in Europe. Nevertheless, it reaches the city's most important landmarks. Opened in 1955, the metro (subway or underground) in Rome has grown slowly over time,\u00a0and currently only operates 37,3 miles (60 km) made up of three lines . It is one of the smallest metros in Europe. Currently, there are plans to expand the subway system . The reason why it's\u00a0so limited\u00a0is that each time a new tunnel is built, more archaeological remains are found;\u00a0something which also happens in Athens . Most important\u00a0metro stations Although the metro only comprises three lines, it gets to most of the city\u2019s top attractions. These are the most important stops to keep in mind: Line A (Orange) The most used by both locals and tourists. It runs through Rome stopping at\u00a027 stations going from northwest to southeast.\u00a0Starting at Battistini and going to Anagnina, the line runs with a frequency of 3 minutes to 5 minutes depending on the day of the week. The most important stops starting from the west are: Cipro - Musei Vaticani : The closest stop to the Vatican Museums and to the Sistine Chapel. Ottaviano - San Pietro : This station is a few minutes\u2019 walk from St. Peter's Square and St. Peter's Basilica. Spagna : Very convenient for visiting Piazza di Spagna and Villa Borghese. Barberini - Fontana di Trevi : This station is five minutes away from Trevi Fountain It is also the closest station to Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Termini: Stops at Roma Termini railway station. Here, visitors can take the Leonardo Express to get to Fiumicino Airport. Line B (Blue) Running from northeast to south, line B goes from Laurentina to Rebibbia or Jonio, as it's also divided into two. It has 22 stations plus an extension of four more. Frequency is 5 minutes on weekdays and about 9 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays. The most important stops starting from the north are: Termini : Transfer point between two lines and arrival point of the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino. Colosseo : Located near the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Piramide : If you come in the FR1 regional train from Fiumicino, you will be able to take the metro from this stop. Line B1 was inaugurated in 2012 and trains split upon arrival at Bologna station, where one branch continues to Rebibbia and another to Jonio. L\u00edne\u00a0C (Verde) Inaugurated in 2014 , this line runs through Rome from the center to the east , connecting San Giovanni (line A) to Monte Compatri-Pantano. It's less significant for tourists since, until its completion, it mainly serves the eastern area with few points of interest. Trains run every 12 minutes, every day of the week Where to get a ticket? Tickets can be purchased at the subway stations, at newsstands, and in most corner shops.

Area Sacra 1 See photo gallery The discovery The Area Sacra was discovered between 1926 and 1930 during construction work on a building. The area was occupied by four temples built in the third century B.C. , and by the Theatre and Curia of Pompey, the place in which Julius Caesar was murdered. As it's not known to whom the temples were dedicated, they were renamed with the letters A, B, C, and D. The city of cats Since the first excavations in the Area of Sacra in Rome were carried out, hundreds of cats have decided to make the area their home . Nowadays, it's very common to see them walking calmly, feeling protected among the ruins. Next to the iron gates that protect the zone, signs can be seen indicating that the cats are welcome and that they should not be mistreated.

This bath\u00a0complex was the largest of ancient Rome. Baths of Diocletian Exhibition in the Baths of Diocletian Cloister of the Baths of Diocletian 3 See photo gallery History The construction of the Roman baths began in 298 and was completed in 306. The structure of the baths was very similar to that of the Baths of Caracalla. They were made of bricks, coated in marble and decorated with mosaics and sculptures . The whole complex took up 120,000 square meters and included a gymnasium, a library, and cold, hot and tepid public baths . During the construction, thousands of Christian slaves died. Diocletian, ill and tired, abdicated in 305. The Roman public baths remained open until 537, when the Goths cut off the aqueducts in an attempt to conquer Rome. In 1561, Pope Pius IV ordered Michelangelo to build the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli on the remains of the baths to honour all the Christian slaves who died. National Museum of Rome Open to the public after thirty years of reconstruction, the 10th Hall of the Baths of Diocletian were made part of the National Museum of Rome in 2008. Nowadays, only a small part can be visited , in which it is possible to see the high ceilings the baths had. The interior of the remains includes an impressive funerary sculpture and two tombs decorated with frescoes and stucco, which are believed to date from the beginning of the second century AD. In the outdoor part of the baths\u00a0it is possible to stroll through a sixteenth century garden with nearly 400 works of art , including statues, sarcophagi and reliefs. Impressive Even though the ruins show only a small part of the public baths complex, it is extremely impressive . Visitors can also explore the tombs,\u00a0which are very well preserved.

It was built to commemorate\u00a0Emperor Ferdinand II's victory\u00a0at the Battle of White Mountain. The basilica has become extremely popular since it appeared in the novel Angels & Demons , written by the American author Dan Brown. In its interior Although the church's fa\u00e7ade isn\u2019t very impressive, its interior is extravagantly decorated. Since there is very little natural light inside the church, it is filled with candles, which create a very special atmosphere . One of the most notable parts of the church is the Cornaro Chapel , which houses the \u201c Ecstasy of Saint Teresa \u201d, a sculpture by Bernini. This figure is considered to be a sculptural masterpiece of the Baroque period. The interior of Santa Maria della Vittoria suffered a fire in 1833 and had to be restored. However, nowadays, it's completely reconstructed. The Fountain of Moses Near the Basilica Santa Maria della Vittoria stands the grandiose Fontana dell\u2019Acqua Felice, in English the Fountain of Moses. It was designed to symbolise the end of the Acqua Felice aqueduct. Although this fountain is not very popular among the Romans on account of its disproportion and its sheer size, it's an imposing architectural ensemble worth taking a look at . Impossible to Visit all the Churches in Rome Because of the vast number of churches in Rome, it's impossible to visit them all.

The Pantheon of Agrippa , also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome . The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 B.C and\u00a0that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D. At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who transformed it into a church , in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state of preservation. Architecture The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres . The dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica . At its top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building. The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: \"M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT\" , which means \"Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built this temple when he was a Consul.\" The interior In the interior of the Pantheon the tombs of numerous Italian kings and a multitude of art works are found. The best-known person who can be found buried in the Pantheon is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael .

        "text":"Rome as Capital of Italy - Recent history of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870 . Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world. The unification process of Italy started in 1848 and ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Since Rome was under the control of the Papacy, Florence was made the temporary capital of Italy. In 1870, Italian troops entered Rome, ending more than one thousand years of Papal control over the city. However, the Pope did not accept the unification of the peninsula and took refuge in the Vatican until February 11th, 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed by Mussolini and Pope Pius XI, creating the Vatican state . Mussolini and the National Fascist Party, allies of Nazi Germany, marched into Rome in 1922 and came to power in the country, declaring a new Italian Empire. During the following years many monuments , buildings and streets were restored and Rome became the administrative capital, increasing the population of Rome, from 212,000 inhabitants to over one million (during the Roman Empire, Rome had over 2 million inhabitants). During World War II, Rome\u00a0was hardly bombed compared to other cities. This was largely due to\u00a0the Americans not wanting to destroy Rome because in its centre was the neutral\u00a0Vatican City and Pope Pius XII, who remained in the city throughout the war. Finally, on June 4th, 1944, Rome was taken by the Allies. In 1946, the monarchy was overthrown and a republic was put in place. During the 50s and 60s, a period known as the Dolce Vita (meaning the sweet life), Rome became a very fashionable city . Next, in the 1980s, the population grew reaching 2,800,000 .\u200b On March 25th 1957, the \u201cTreaty of Rome\u201d was signed in this city by 6 countries. It established the European Economic Community (EEC) and The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). The \u201cTreaty of Rome\u201d would later give birth to the creation of the European\u00a0Union. Rome in the 21st Century Currently, Rome\u2019s historic centre still reflects its colourful past. Visitors will find traces of ancient Rome , Renaissance palaces, fountains, piazzas , Baroque churches and other architectural styles\u00a0dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. As the capital of Italy, Rome has most of the country's political buildings. The population has grown exponentially and now is at about 2.8 million.

The Basilica is the oldest church in Europe. Founded during the fourth century in honour of St. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, St John Lateran (Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano) is the Cathedral of Rome and the most important of the four major basilicas. It is known as St John Lateran Archbasilica, as is it considered the mother church of the Roman Catholic faithful. History In the early part of the fourth century, the Laterani family were stripped of their land as one of their members was accused of conspiring against the Emperor. It was given to the Bishop of Rome in order to build the first Roman basilica. Throughout the centuries, St John Lateran has survived several fires and an earthquake in 897. Nevertheless, it still maintains its first form even though it has been reconstructed on several occasions. Near the Archbasilica there\u00a0was a monastery, which has completely disappeared now;\u00a0the only part still standing is its beautiful cloister from the thirteenth century. \u00a0The Basilica also houses a baptistery, which for many years was the only baptistery in Rome. The Basilica of St. John Lateran has played an important role throughout history; it was here that all popes were enthroned up until 1870. Nowadays, Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterno is where the Pope, as Bishop of Rome, celebrates Holy Thursday Mass. Interior The two-story portico on the Basilica\u2019s main fa\u00e7ade was constructed during the eighteenth century, and it is where the Pope blesses the congregation on Holy Thursday. On the top part of the fa\u00e7ade\u00a0visitors will see imposing statues of the Apostles and Jesus, also dating from the eighteenth century. The central doors made of bronze were previously used at the Roman Senate House (the Curia Julia) within the Roman Forum . The Basilica\u2019s interior is magnificent with colossal statues, mosaics and frescoes from the ceiling to the ground, with impressive columns. The Holy Stairs (Scala Santa) are located near the Lateran Basilica. These are renowned because it is believed that Jesus Christ stepped on them during His Passion. They were relocated from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by St Helena. One of the most beautiful basilicas of Rome The Cathedral of Rome is among the most beautiful churches in Rome and is a definite must-see. We also recommend visiting San Clemente and Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini .

        "text":"Villa d'Este (Tivoli) - Reviews and how to get there and back Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa d'Este (Tivoli) Villa d\u2019Este is a sumptuous Renaissance dwelling located in the outskirts of Rome. It stands out for its beautiful gardens and charmingly decorated rooms. A former Franciscan monastery expropriated by the governor of Tivoli, the Villa d\u2019Este was built during the sixteenth century in Tivoli as a stately Renaissance-style mansion with enchanting gardens. Nowadays, it is a museum listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. What to see All the rooms in Villa d\u2019Este are beautifully decorated with frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings. However, the most breathtaking part of the villa is the fantastic views of the garden and countryside below. Strolling through the mansion\u2019s lush gardens full of sculptures and over 500 fountains is the best part of the visit. The enclosure\u2019s Hundred Fountains (Cento Fontane in Italian), located between the Fontana di Rometta and the oval fountain, is an architectural masterpiece. The garden also houses a superb waterfall, and the Fountain of the Organ (Fontana dell\u2019Organo) is worthwhile discovering. In 1571, the fountain had a water organ installed in it, which was\u00a0astonishing to everyone who heard it. A perfect getaway If you want to spend a day discovering Tivoli, Villa d\u2019Este is a definite must. Exploring its gardens while enjoying the coolness of its fountains and the shade of its trees is extremely agreeable, especially in summer. Villa d\u2019Este is located just 19 miles (30 km) from Rome, making it a perfect getaway trip from the bustling city. Visitors can combine this visit with Villa Adriana , which is located very close by. Getting to Villa d\u2019Este There are several ways of getting to Villa d\u2019Este: Guided tour : This is the easiest option. It includes a hotel pick-up, transport there and back, guided tour in English and admissions tickets. The price per person is \u20ac 125\u00a0and can be booked here: Villa Adriana and Villa d'Este Excursion . Bus : The buses that travel from Rome to Tivoli leave from the bus station Ponte Mammolo ( metro line B) and the company name is Cotral. It costs \u20ac 2 to \u20ac 3per journey. Car rental : We recommend this option if you\u2019re planning on renting a car for a few days, otherwise it is quite expensive and isn\u2019t worthwhile. You can rent a car here . Although it is also possible to go by train, it takes 1 - 1.5 hours, costs \u20ac 3 and leaves you further away from Villa d\u2019Este than the bus. If you\u2019d also like to visit Villa Adriana , there is a bus connecting both mansions for \u20ac 1.

        "text":"Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli - Opening hours and location Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli The Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli (St. Peter in Chains) was built in the 5th century to house the chains with which St. Peter was imprisoned in Jerusalem. The church is also known for its famous sculpture of Michelangelo's Moses. Origins of the Basilica According to legend, Empress Eudoxia gave Pope Leo I the chains with which Saint Peter had been shackled in Jerusalem as a present, and to house these, he commissioned San Pietro in Vincoli Basilica to be built. When Pope Leo I held these chains near Peter\u2019s chains from the time he spent in Mamertime Prison in Rome Inside San Pietro in Vincoli The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is different from any other church built during the same period thanks to its simplicity and scarce decoration. Under the main altar is the reliquary in which the chains of Saint Peter, the church\u2019s most important element, are kept. Another impressive part of the church is the mausoleum of Pope Julius II, made up of Michelangelo\u2019s striking statue of Moses, designed between 1505 and 1515. The mausoleum is dimly lit until one of the visitors makes a donation and it lights up, something which is done throughout most of the churches in Rome. Among the small altars found on both sides of the church, we recommend taking a close look at those found on the left-hand side. Visitors will see frescoes depicting skeletons and other images which are not very commonly shown in Catholic churches. Well worth visiting The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli is well worth visiting not only because of its unique decoration and Michelangelo\u2019s massive statue of Moses, but because\u00a0it is unlike any other Roman church.

Magnificent buildings surround three sides of the square. Obelisk and the Fontana di Castore e Polluce One of the most striking elements of the square is the obelisk , which is located next to the statues on which Castor and Pollux, patrons of horse riders , are taming several\u00a0horses. One of the most striking elements of the square is the obelisk with a fountain located at its feet. On either side of the monument, there are two statues of Castor and Pollux , each flanked by a horse. These twin brothers from Roman mythology were considered the patron gods of horses. Before being relocated to Piazza del Quirinale, the statues had decorated the entrance of the Baths of Constantine and the obelisk had stood on the Mausoleum of Augustus. Palazzo del Quirinale Designed as a summer residence for Pope Gregory XIII in 1573, the Palazzo del Quirinale became the royal family residence after the unification of Italy . After Italy had become a republic, the palace became the presidential home in 1947. Changing of the guard The changing of the guard ceremony takes place every day at 3 pm in front of the Palazzo Quirinale .

        "text":"Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was designed by Michelangelo and is the only Renaissance style church in Rome. The temple, located very near Piazza della Repubblica , is one of the most surprising and unique in the city thanks to its ruined fa\u00e7ade that contrasts\u00a0with its vast and sensational interior. Construction of the temple The site where Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri was erected was where the Baths of Diocletian had been founded, an impressive demonstration of the glory of the Roman Empire until, in an intent to conquer Rome, the Goths cut the water supply of all the aqueducts of the city, and the baths had to be\u00a0abandoned. When neglected, the baths were taken over by bandits and courtesans until the Renaissance, when the grounds were bought by the French cardinal Jean du Bellay, who commissioned the construction of a beautiful villa and its gardens. A Sicilian priest suggested building a church on the site of the Baths of Diocletian, in honour of all the Christian slaves who died while building the baths. Several decades later, in 1560, the priest\u2019s efforts were rewarded by Pope Pius IV who commissioned Michelangelo to transform the baths into a church. Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli The interior of the church is remarkable and completely unpredictable from looking at its bare fa\u00e7ade. \u00a0With an impressive dimension, the temple is beautifully decorated with vast frescoes on its walls and enormous coloured marble columns. On the floor, visitors will be able to see the meridian solar line built by the astronomer and philosopher Francesco Bianchini in 1703. \u00a0Bianchini\u2019s meridian would tell when noon was throughout the year, the arrival of the solstices and equinox, as well as a calendar. Santa Maria degli Angeli houses an\u00a0impressive organ, recently bought, with 5,400 tubes. It is capable of leaving the church\u2019s visitors who are lucky enough to hear it spellbound. A very special temple There are countless churches of all sizes and from different periods in Rome, but, without a doubt, Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is one of the most remarkable and impressive churches in the city.

        "text":"Ostia Antica - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Ostia Antica Once the harbour city of ancient Rome, Ostia Antica is now a vast archeological site, located near the city of Rome. The town was abandoned and buried for over ten centuries until it was rediscovered. Book a guided tour Nowadays, Ostia Antica is a large archaeological site. Located just 19 miles (30 km) west of Rome and on the River Tiber.\u00a0During ancient Rome, it was one of the most thriving cities in the region thanks to its status as Rome\u2019s harbour city. After the collapse of the Empire, the city fell into decadence, was eventually abandoned and remained untouched and magnificently preserved for centuries. History Ostia Antica became Rome\u2019s main seaport during the Roman Republic (509 BC \u2013 27 BC) and the city was largely improved by Julius Caesar and Tiberius,\u00a0during part of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, the Romans slowly began to depend on other ports, meaning that the commercial activity in Ostia slowed down until it fell into decay during the fourth century AD. During the same period, the inhabitants of Ostia were hit by malaria and many fled to save their lives. This is how a city which had once a population of 100,000, was abandoned and turned into a forgotten port during several centuries. The city is relatively well preserved, but not as well as Pompeii or Herculaneum , where the cities were completely buried under volcanic ash and mud. What to see The archaeological site still houses the remains of most of the city\u2019s buildings before it was abandoned. Ostia\u2019s main arterial street, called Decumanus Maximus in Roman cities, cuts through the whole city, while the arcades on both sides of the street show the houses and shops which once thrived here. There are also taverns, inns, shops, public baths and a large reconstructed theatre, which is still used during the summer. The harbour city had a very cosmopolitan population, visible thanks to\u00a0a Jewish synagogue, a Christian Basilica and the\u00a018 temples dedicated to the Persian god Mithra. Less interesting than Pompeii If you aren\u2019t going to visit Pompeii or Herculaneum, then Ostia Antica is an archaeological site well worth visiting in which it is possible to imagine how the city\u2019s inhabitants lived centuries ago. However, compared to Pompeii or Herculaneum, it is less impressive and less well preserved. If you visit the site during the summer, we recommend taking water and a hat to protect you from the sun, since there is little shade in the site. Directions from Rome Unless you have a car or wish to book a guided tour, Ostia Antica is very close to Rome and is easy to get to by public transport. To get there using public transportation take the metro (line B) and get off at Piramide. Here, take the Roma Lido commuter train to Ostia Antica. Once at the station, all you have to do is follow the crowd. It is a 10-minute walk away. The train to Ostia costs \u20ac 1.50\u00a0(like any other one-way journey ). Since you are going to use quite a lot of public transport, you might want to buy a day pass.

Find out the main bus lines in Rome, their schedules and frequencies and tips to help you get around the city on this type of public transport. Since the metro lines of Rome are rather limited, visitors will most likely need the bus public transport system to get to certain parts of the city. It may not be the most comfortable or punctual form of transportation .\u00a0Nevertheless, to get to certain monuments and museums it is essential to use the bus . Currently, Rome has 338 bus lines that run throughout the day, 22 night buses and 8,260 stops . While the\u00a0size is impressive based on the numbers alone, delays and long waits are also worth mentioning as quite common occurrences. Presently, Rome has introduced a fleet of electric vehicles . Types of buses In Rome there are various types of lines, these are the most popular: Urban lines (U) : The large majority. They start between 5 am and 6:30 am and finish at midnight. It's important to note that the frequency varies. Night buses (N) : These lines operate while the urban lines \"rest\", that is to say, between midnight and 5:00-6:00 am. They operate with very little frequency but are very punctual. Express (X) : These lines are for the outskirts of Rome, for longer journeys. Exact (E) : These lines link the centre with the surrounding neighbourhoods. They run on fixed timetables. How to catch a bus? Are the bus lines in Rome the most complex in Europe? They might just be. Fortunately, each stop provides detailed information about the bus lines that serve it. This includes the route, operating days, and the schedule for the first and last buses. While this information seems straightforward, the reality on the ground can be different. When you've been waiting for half an hour without seeing a bus, you'll understand the challenge. Luckily, many bus stops are being upgraded with electronic displays showing the time until the next bus arrives. Buses also transmit their location to dispatchers, who notify passengers in three different ways In arrivo : the bus is arriving 3 Fer 2' : 3 stops away (fermate), arriving in 2 minutes A capolinea : the bus is at the first stop along its route Where to buy a bus ticket? Bus tickets can be bought in any metro station, newsstand or convenience store . If you are planning on using the bus regularly, we recommend you buy a few at a time or get a travel card , which might be a better option. Always validate your ticket Although at first you may think that everyone sneaks on the buses, the reason no one validates the ticket is because they have monthly passes. Remember that you can enter through any door, but don't forget to insert the ticket in the machines or you may be fined even if you have the ticket .

It is the first modern square to be designed in Rome . Book this guided tour The piazza came about because Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, organized a visit to Rome in 1536. Pope Paul III was so dismayed by the state of the sodden Capitoline Hill that he commissioned Michelangelo to design a square. The design of the square Michelangelo wanted the square to face St Peter\u2019s Basilica , the political centre of Rome, instead of the Roman Forum. \u00a0He also proposed the construction of another palace, Palazzo Nuovo , which would face Palazzo dei Conservatori . This palace, in its turn, would have a new fa\u00e7ade. The Palazzo Senatorio \u2019s front would also be redesigned so that all the buildings and the square would work harmoniously. An imposing bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was erected in the centre of the square. It is currently housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori and in the square stands a replica of the Roman Emperor instead. The execution of the plans took so long that Michelangelo didn\u2019t live to see his work completed. Nevertheless, his designs were followed meticulously and finished several centuries later. Twenty-first century Piazza del Campidoglio The Piazza del Campidoglio is one of the most beautiful squares in Rome , attracting millions of visitors every year. Its popularity is also due to its proximity to the Capitoline Museums and the legendary sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf , situated between the Palazzo Senatorio and Palazzo Nuovo.

        "text":"Basilica di San Clemente - Basilica in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di San Clemente The Basilica di San Clemente is a minor basilica dedicated to Pope Clement I. This temple is remarkable because archaeologically, it records the history of Rome from the beginning of Christianity up until the Middle Ages. History During the second century AD, the site on which the church now stands was occupied by a Roman mansion owned by Titus Flavius Clemens, one of the first Roman senators to convert to Christianity. The house was used for Christian clandestine worship since being Christian at the time was forbidden. Approximately a century later, a temple dedicated to Mithras, an all-seeing Protector of the Truth, was built on the same site. It would remain in use for the performance of rites of initiation until the late third century. On the second floor of the mansion, a large room was built, which would later become a basilica commissioned by Pope Siricius\u00a0after the end of Christian persecution in 313 AD. It is believed that the church was badly damaged during the Norman sack of Rome in 1084. It was thus abandoned and buried under the level of the streets of the city. Years later, a new church, commissioned by Pope Paschal II, was erected on the same site and finished in 1108. It is the same that still stands today. Interior At first sight, the Basilica of San Clemente looks like any other church in Rome. However, inside there are numerous and unimaginable treasures. The small temple is beautifully decorated with twelfth-century mosaics. The entrance to the fourth-century church is through the sacristy, in which, despite the cold, darkness and moisture, visitors will be able to see the numerous frescoes on the walls, as well as some fragments of mosaics that used to cover the temple floor. Not only is the old basilica open, but visitors can also see the ancient Roman villas made of old brick. In one of the rooms, water flows through the Cloaca Maxima, the main sewer system of ancient Rome. A walk through the past San Clemente is a unique attraction, definitely worth visiting. It not only offers a visit to a beautiful temple from the twelfth century, but visitors can also discover a fourth-century temple and an old Roman mansion, walking down dark and humid passageways.

        "text":"Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire was founded when Augustus Caesar proclaimed himself the first emperor of Rome in 31 BC and came to an end with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. An empire is a political system in which a group of people are ruled by a single individual, an emperor or empress . The Roman Empire began with the reign of Emperor Augustus. The power of the Senate was limited and became an organ to support the emperor. The period between Augustus and Diocletian is called the High Empire, while\u00a0the Low Empire is the era between Diocletian and the fall of the Roman Empire in the West. The High Empire (31 BC -\u00a0305 AD) The Roman Empire at its territorial peak Between the years 14 and 68\u00a0the heirs of Augustus succeeded him: Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. This dynastic succession was interrupted when emperor Nero died and a civil war broke out in the year 68. Three emperors fought for power and finally, the war was won by Vespasian, part of the Flavian dynasty. The Flavian dynasty was succeeded by the Antonines (96 \u2013 193) , a generic name given to Nerva , Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus . These emperors had a very similar policy to the Flavians. The accession of Septimius Severus (197 -\u00a0235) made him the first of the Imperial Severan Dynasty to rule (197 - 235). He was replaced by\u00a0Caracalla, Macrinus, Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. The absolute power of Rome, the capital of the Empire, was weakened over time. Between 235 and 300\u00a0Rome\u2019s only priority was to defend its borders from the continuous attacks by the Barbarians and from the Sasanians (from Persia). The pressure of these raids prompted the army to assume power in 235. This era is known as the military anarchy and lasted about 50 years. The emperors of this time had one sole purpose:\u00a0fighting the Empire\u2019s enemies and securing the borders. As a consequence of these constant wars, the army was\u00a0very expensive to maintain, and thus\u00a0the Empire became crippled with debts. This in turn impoverished the population and many lost their identity and values. Many were put in doubt of their religious beliefs, especially with the arrival of new doctrines from the East. The persecution of an ever-growing Christian minority by Diocletian was a way to rid the empire of the dangers it was facing . In 284 a military revolt saved the Empire and Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. During his rule\u00a0he instaured the Tetrarchy, a form of government that divided the power. Diocletian designated the general Maximian to take charge of the western regions of the Empire, while the emperor governed over the eastern regions. Years later, he would appoint two Caesars. Diocletian abdicated in 305, revealing that the Tetrarchic political system didn\u2019t work without someone to lead it. The Low Empire (305 AD - 476 AD) After the abdication of Diocletian in 305, a series of conflicts took place until 312, when Constantine became the sole emperor of the West. He was to be the last emperor of the unified empire. He instituted Christianity as the official religion of the Empire. The capital of the Empire is moved to the ancient city of Byzantium , which is reconstructed. Byzantium, from November 8th, 324, was renamed Constantinople or the city of Constantine. Constantine\u2019s successor, Theodosius,\u00a0divided the empire between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius, creating the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476. Meanwhile, the other half,\u00a0called the Byzantine Empire , survived\u00a0until 1453 with the decline of Constantinople, now called Istanbul .

        "text":"Herculaneum - Opening hours, tickets & how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Herculaneum Located in the region of Campania, the town of Herculaneum suffered the same fate as Pompeii . The town was buried under Mount Vesuvius\u2019s volcanic ashes and mud in 79 AD. Hit before Pompeii, many inhabitants didn\u2019t have time to escape and were engulfed in layers of debris, ashes and mud, dying instantly to be preserved for centuries. What to see At the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the city was the volcano\u2019s first victim, and therefore\u00a0the first wall of lava, ashes, debris and gases covered Herculaneum completely a little after midnight on 25 August. The previous day, it had been plunged in a cloud of debris leaving it without sunlight. A UNESCO world heritage site , Herculaneum is better preserved than Pompeii . The city\u2019s houses, baths, taverns, temples and figures are undamaged; therefore, visitors will get a real sense of the splendour of this Roman city. Wealthier than its neighbouring Pompeii, the town is full of beautiful buildings. The different floors of most of the buildings are still intact and it is possible to see the magnificent frescoes and mosaics covering the walls of palaces, public buildings and mansions. On the far side of the city are the most luxurious villas overlooking the sea, notably the Villa dei Papiri, which was the luxurious retreat of Julius Caesar\u2019s father-in-law. In Herculaneum, archaeologists have also found the first Roman preserved skeletons from the first century, since prior to this period\u00a0Romans would cremate the dead. The skeletons are on display in one of the city\u2019s houses. Beautifully conserved The town of Herculaneum has been magically conserved all these years . Objects like beds, and doors managed to remain under the layers of ash and mud without decaying. Although it isn\u2019t as well-known or as large as Pompeii , Herculaneum\u2019s ruins are extremely impressive and gripping . Definitely worth visiting! Today, the town of Ercolano lies extremely close to the ruins of Herculaneum, creating an interesting contrast. Getting to Herculaneum The most common ways of getting to Herculaneum from Rome are: Train : Visitors need to take a train to Naples to get to Herculaneum. These leave from Termini railway station. Once in Naples, the Circumvesuviana line goes to Herculaneum (Ercolano Scavi station). It takes between 2 \u2013 3 hours to get there and the prices range from \u20ac 30 to \u20ac 100 for a roundtrip , depending on the train. Car rental : Although this is the cheapest option for families or groups of friends, you must keep in mind the price of petrol, parking and tolls. We would recommend this option only for those thinking of renting a car for additional days to visit other attractions nearby .

The most accepted date for the foundation of Rome is 753 BC . The first form of government in Rome was monarchical according to the archaeological findings and the legends. In the excavations carried out in the Roman Forum , in the Regia, which was the former royal residence, a glass of bucchero was found dating from the 7th century BC with the inscription Rex (king). The word regei was also found on the Lapis Niger, an ancient shrine in the Roman Forum. An inscription found beneath the black marble is considered to be a law. It's also possible to figure out when Rome was a kingdom thanks to other institutions in the Lazio region. For example, the rex Nemorensis (king of the forest), a priest of the goddess Diana who looked after the forests from the 6th century BC until the Roman Empire. Curiously, the Romans would maintain the same institutions throughout the centuries, transforming the roles of those in charge to suit the period. In this case, during the Roman Republic, the figure of the rex sacrorum (king of the sacred) substituted the king figure\u00a0but was only given religious functions. Romulus, son of the god of war and the daughter of the king Numitor, was the first king of Rome and also its founder, thus the city was called after him. He formed the Roman Senate with one hundred men and gave the inhabitants of Rome a body of laws. The Growth of Rome After founding the city, Romulus invited merchants and men of all kinds to settle in Palatine Hill. To increase the female population and give Rome\u2019s inhabitants wives, he abducted Sabine women. As a consequence, the Sabine King , Titus Tatius attacked Rome and took the Capitol . Finally , Romulus shared the kingship of the city with Titus Tatius until his death. The list of the 7 kings of Rome, or 8 if we include Titus Tatius, is as follows: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, Tarquinius Superbus . No historian doubts the existence of the last 3 kings, since there is clear evidence of their reigns in Rome. Nowadays, it's also believed that the first 3 kings of Rome also existed. Certain historians argue that the name of these 7 kings dates back to when the first Roman historians, in the 3rd century BC, wrote about the origins of Rome, which would confirm them to be true.

        "text":"Villa Adriana (Tivoli) - What to see in Tivoli from Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Villa Adriana (Tivoli) Nowadays, an important Roman archaeological site, Villa Adriana was commissioned by the Emperor Hadrian as a retreat from his palace in the capital. Book a day trip Located just outside of Tivoli, Villa Adriana is a collection of classical buildings created in the second century under the orders of Emperor Hadrian. It was a \u201csmall town\u201d consisting of palaces, fountains, and baths, as well as other structures that mimic various Greek and Egyptian architectural styles. The construction of Villa Adriana came about due to the fact that Adriano was unhappy in the palace on Palatine Hill, and he created it as his place of retreat. After his death, it was used by various successors, but eventually fell into disuse and ended up in ruins, which were looted. What to see in Villa Adriana With an area of 120 hectares\u00a0(296 acres), on which there are reconstructions of the emperor\u2019s favorite Greek and Egyptian buildings, Villa Adriana is a great architectural treasure that requires several hours for a visit. One of the most noteworthy parts of the villa, known as Canopus, is a copy of a sanctuary located near Alexandria. It's an enormous pool surrounded by columns and decorated with figures of the caryatids. Among the libraries, bathrooms, guest houses, gardens, fountains, and ponds, stands a structure known as the Maritime Theatre, a circular pool surrounded by columns with an island in the middle. On the island, there is a small Roman villa. The splendor of the past Although during the 16th century,\u00a0many of the statues and marble elements of Villa Adriana were looted to decorate the nearby Villa d'Este, you can still see how magnificent the villa was during its peak. If you have time to take a day trip to Tivoli from Rome, we believe it's definitely worth visiting both Villa Adriana and Villa d\u2019Este.\u00a0If you have time, take the opportunity to have lunch at Tivoli! Getting to Villa Adriana There are several ways to get to Tivoli\u00a0from Rome: Take a day trip : The easiest and most comfortable way to get to Tivoli from Rome is to take a day trip. This option includes hotel pickup, transport, an official English-speaking guide and entrance fees. The price of the excursion to Villa Adriana is \u20ac 125 per person and can be booked here: Hadrian's Villa and Villa d'Este Day Trip . Bus: The buses that make the journey from Rome to Tivoli are from the Cotral company, and they depart from the Ponte Mammolo station ( Metro line B). The fare is \u20ac 2 and the travel time is about 45 minutes. Rent a car: this option is a good one if you have it rented for more than just one day, if not, it's not worth it. You can rent a car in Rome by clicking here . Although it's possible to go by train from Rome to Villa Adriana, but we'd say it's not worthwhile. The trip is longer, about 1 hour depending on the train you take, although there are tickets from \u20ac 4. If you are visiting Villa d'Este, there is a bus that connects both villas for \u20ac 1.

History Originally, the Crypta housed a theatre, a block of four apartments and a patio . Built between 19 and 13 BC under Lucius Cornelius Balbus. The theatre had a crypt where people would go during the intermissions of the different plays. Over time, the theatre was forgotten and buried under other constructions.\u00a0Excavations on the site started in 1981 and twenty years later the remains were opened to the public and became part of the National Museum of Rome. Exhibitions The upper floor of the building features objects from the Antiquity and the Middle Ages, successfully depicting how the Romans lived between the fifth and tenth century. The ground floor presents what was found during the excavation. It is placed in such a way that visitors can get an idea of the history of the area.

        "text":"The History of Rome - From the Roman Empire up to the present day Civitatis Rome General Information The History of Rome How was Rome founded? How did it become an Empire? What was the role of the Catholic Church throughout Rome\u2019s history? Learn about the fascinating past of this striking city before you travel to Rome. The exact origins of the city of Rome are still somewhat of a mystery . There are several theories all based on the writings of ancient authors and the archaeological discoveries . For this reason, the founding of Rome is based mainly on legend and myth , instead of solid facts and figures. The existence of a Roman Kingdom was even questioned for\u00a0practically two centuries by expert historians. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they dismissed the idea of the early kings of Rome (Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius) as well as the date of the founding of what would later become the capital of Italy, in 753 BC. This part of history was merely considered a legend and not taken seriously. It was only during the late 20th century when, thanks to the findings of numerous archaeological\u00a0digs and other sciences,\u00a0the myths surrounding the establishment of the city and its first rulers were reconsidered . It's believed that the first inhabitants of Rome came from various parts of the region, and had neither the economic nor the cultural development of their northern neighbours, the Etruscans, nor\u00a0the southern civilization called the Sabines and Latins. In Palatine Hill ,\u00a0archaeologists\u00a0found the remains of a primitive settlement from the 8th century BC , with burials on the outskirts of the village. It's thought that as the population grew, the inhabitants settled on the slopes of the nearby hills, and during the next century\u00a0they established themselves in the valley. The history of Rome in stages Romulus and Remus Legend or not, Romulus and Remus, twins who grew up raised by a she-wolf, have gone down in history as the founders of Rome. The Monarchy (753 BC - 509 BC) When the city of Rome was founded in 754 BC, it had a monarchical form of government. Find out how the Monarchy was overthrown and what came next. Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Romans created a republican government after the overthrow of the Monarchy. During this period the legal system of ancient Rome was established. Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) The Roman Empire is one of the greatest civilisations of all time, starting with the Republic's fall in 27 BC and ending with the last Emperor in 476 AD. The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and moving the capital to Constantinople, the Pope became more powerful in Rome over the following years. Rome as Capital of Italy With the unification of Italy, Rome was chosen capital of the country in 1870. Nowadays, it's one of the most visited cities in the world.

        "text":"Catacombs of Rome - Underground burial places Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Catacombs of Rome The Catacombs of Rome are former underground burial grounds that date from the second to the fifth century and were principally used by Christians and Jews. Book a Tour The catacombs are subterranean passageways that were used as place of burial for a number of centuries . The burials of Jewish, pagan and early Christian Roman citizens in the catacombs began in the second century and ended in the fifth century. The word catacomb, which means \"next to the quarry\", comes from the fact that the first excavations to be used as a place of burial were carried out in the outskirts of Rome, next to the site of a quarry . The reason for the catacombs The Christians did not agree with the pagan custom of burning the bodies of their dead, for which reason\u00a0to solve problems created from a lack of space and the high price of land they decided to create these vast underground cemeteries. The catacombs possess a huge number of subterranean passageways that form real labyrinths that are several kilometres long , along which rows of rectangular niches were dug out . The corpses were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which were then covered with gravestones made of marble or, more commonly, baked clay. Subsequently, the name of the deceased was carved on the cover\u00a0accompanied by a Christian symbol . Roman law at the time prohibited the burial of the deceased in the interior of the city, for which reason all of the catacombs were located outside of the walls. These separated and hidden places below ground constituted the perfect refuge in which the Christians could bury their own, freely using Christian symbols . The end of persecutions On signing the Edict of Milan in the year 313, the persecution of Christians ceased , and they could begin to build churches and acquire land without fear of confiscation. In spite of this they continued to use the catacombs as cemeteries until the 5th century . During the barbarian invasion of Italy in the 8th century\u00a0many catacombs suffered continuous lootings, for which reason the Popes caused the still remaining relics to be transferred to the city's churches . After these transfers, some catacombs were abandoned completely and forgotten for centuries . Catacombs of Rome In Rome there are more than sixty catacombs made up of hundreds of kilometres of underground passageways that hold thousands of tombs. Currently only five of them are open to the public : Catacombs of San Sebastiano (Via Appia Antica, 136): These 12 kilometre long catacombs owe their name to San Sebastiano, a soldier who became a martyr for converting to Christianity. Together with those of San Callisto they are the best that can be visited. Opening times are Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of San Callisto (Via Appia Antica, 126): With a network of passageways over 20 kilometres in length, the tombs of San Callisto were the burial place of 16 pontiffs and scores of Christian martyrs. Opening times are Thursday to Tuesday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Priscilla (Via Salaria, 430): These hold some frescoes that have great importance for art history, such as the first representations of the Virgin Mary. Opening times are Tuesday to Sunday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Domitilla (Via delle Sette Chiese, 280): Discovered in 1593, these catacombs, which\u00a0are more than 15 kilometres in length, owe their name to the granddaughter of Vespasian. Opening times are Wednesday to Monday from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 17:00. Catacombs of Sant\u2019Agnese (Via Nomentana, 349): After being a martyr because of her Christian faith, Sant\u2019Agnese was buried in the catacombs that subsequently bore her name. Opening times are from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 16:00 to 18:00; the catacombs are closed on Sunday mornings and Monday afternoons. How to get to the Catacombs To visit the catacombs, you have several options: Take a tour : reserving\u00a0a visit is the easiest way of visiting the catacombs and monuments on the Via Appia. Here you can reserve a tour which includes transport, tickets, and an official guide. Public bus : although it's the cheapest way to get there, you can lose plenty of time heading there on your own. The 118 and 218 lines head to\u00a0San Calixto and\u00a0San Sebasti\u00e1n, and lines 218 and 716 go to Domitila. Taxi : the high price, and difficulty in finding a taxi for the return journey to Rome means we don't recommend this option. A walk through the insides of Rome The catacombs of Rome offer a very special visit in which the funeral remains of those buried many centuries ago can be seen. It is fascinating to travel through the dark and damp passageways, where you can see, in addition to the niches, some inscriptions with the names of the people that once occupied them. Due to the high infant mortality at that time, you can see a large quantity of spaces prepared for these children, alongside some larger graves in which the whole family was buried . During the visit, a guide who is specialized in the topic gives the visitors several\u00a0interesting facts relating to the catacombs and the period in which they were operating . The guided tours are in Spanish and are included in the cost of entrance.

        "text":"The Papacy in Rome - Rome after the fall of the Empire Civitatis Rome General Information History The Papacy in Rome After the fall of the Roman Empire and the transfer of the imperial capital to Constantinople, the Pope gained power and became the sole authority in Rome. Since the capital of the Eastern Empire was moved to Constantinople and what was left of the Western Empire was taken to Ravenna, Rome lost its power and the only authority left was that of the Pope , who consolidated his power with the help of the Lombards and Charlemagne. Until 751, when it was invaded by the Lombards, Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. In 756, Pepin the Short granted the Pope power over regions near Rome, giving rise to the Papal States. The development of ancient Christianity made the Bishop of Rome both religiously and politically important and established Rome as the centre of Christianity. Until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, Rome was the capital of the Papal States . Until the 19th century, the papacy was in a constant struggle with the Holy Roman Empire and other powers in Europe . Nonetheless, Rome became a very powerful and wealthy city, with great international importance. Factors that contributed to Rome becoming such an important place during the Papacy include: first, it became the most important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages , secondly, in 1300 Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the first Holy Year (Jubilee), a year of great importance for Christians; thirdly,\u00a0the councils; fourth,\u00a0the Papal patronage became the focus of rebirth replacing Florence and finally the cultural influence of the city itself. The papal authority continued to be extremely strong until the 19th century. The End of Papal Authority The French Revolution put an end to the papal power. With the 1848 revolution, Rome became part of the unified Italy. After the battle of Porta Pia in 1870 (a battle led by Pius IX to maintain\u00a0his sovereignty over the Papal States) Rome was declared the new capital of Italy .

It provides some breath-taking views of Rome. The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele was inaugurated in 1911 as a tribute to Victor Emmanuel II , the first king of Italy after the country's\u00a0unification. Inside the building is the Institute for the History of the Italian Risorgimento and the Central Museum of the Risorgimento. Since 1921, the Victor Emmanuel Monument holds the tomb of the unknown soldier , a place in which the eternal flame shines and which is always guarded by two soldiers. A spectacular monument The colossal monument, which is 135 meters wide and 70 meters high , is comprised of scores of majestic Corinthian columns and endless stairs , all carved in white marble . The top is crowned with an equestrian sculpture of Victor Emmanuel cast in bronze and two chariots driven by the goddess Victoria. The monument was strongly criticised at its construction, since it was necessary to knock down numerous valuable buildings to make sufficient space, and Italian citizens did not agree with the idea of having such an eye-catching and elaborate building next to the other classical buildings that surround it . Panoramic terrace One of the greatest attractions of the Monument to Victor Emmanuel is the panoramic view that can be seen from the terrace located at the same height as the chariots . The panoramic elevators are the only way to reach the upper part of the monument, but the amazing views make it worth the effort to climb . The Museum of the Risorgimento The base of the monument holds the Museum of the Risorgimento;\u00a0a museum dedicated to the unification of Italy in which weapons, flags and other objects related to this historic moment are exhibited. Though\u00a0it may be an essential visit for Italian citizens, is not too interesting for foreign visitors. Cannot be ignored The Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the most eye-catching buildings of the whole city .

Located in a building east of the Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish Steps , the museum contains many reminders of the lives of both poets and other writers of the time. History In November 1820, the English poet John Keats moved to Rome believing that the warm Italian climate would improve the health problems he suffered due to tuberculosis. Within less than a year he died in the same house where he lived, and in accordance with the laws of the time, his belongings were burned to prevent the spread of the disease. In 1906 the house was purchased by an American poet who restored it and turned it into the memorial it is today. During World War II, the house had to be hidden to prevent its destruction and the objects that were kept were sent to an abbey, where they remained hidden until 1944. Exhibitions The Keats-Shelley House has a large collection of manuscripts, first editions, sculptures and paintings depicting the lives of the poets to which it pays homage. The house also has one of the finest libraries of Romantic literature in the world, to which thousands of volumes are added every year. Not a must-see Unless you're a big lover of literature, Keat-Shelley House isn't one of the must-sees in Rome. We only recommend it to those who have an extended time in the city.

In Italy\u2019s capital, you\u2019ll find a wide variety of small shops selling traditional products, high streets, department stores and top international designer boutiques. Traditional products One of the most popular traditional products to buy in Italy is pasta. Visitors will find all types of pasta of different shapes and sizes, flavour and ingredients throughout the city. The best places to buy Italian pasta are in supermarkets or specialized shops. The most extravagant variations can cost up to \u20ac 4\u00a0for a 500-gram bag. Other products that make great presents are limoncello, olive oil or vinegar. If you like parmesan cheese, you can get some in Rome, which is normally a lot cheaper and better quality than in the rest of Europe or the US. If you want to spend as little as possible on these souvenirs, then the best place to get them is in a supermarket, although these are sometimes hard to find in the city. Fashion The Italian love of fashion is well known and the fact is that, although it is not Milan, Rome has some of the best designer boutiques in Italy. If you\u2019d like to discover these shops, head to Via del Corso, where the most prestigious boutiques are located, or to the streets surrounding Piazza di Spagna , especially Via dei Condotti, where you\u2019ll find Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari or Armani. Then walk to Via Veneto, where there are other stores of the same standard. If you\u2019re looking for counterfeit products, especially bags, you\u2019ll be surprised at how many people sell\u00a0these on the popular streets of Rome. It is possible to purchase a Gucci replica bag for \u20ac 20. Art and antiques Via del Babuino, connecting Piazzi di Spagna\u00a0to Piazza del Popolo , is famous for its antique and art shops. Via Margutta, which runs parallel to Via del Babuino, is also worth visiting. Souvenirs and gifts Souvenir shops and street stalls are found in Rome\u2019s most important tourist spots. If you are good at bargaining, you will be able to get the typical figurines and other souvenirs for great prices. Department stores Unlike most capital cities in Europe, Rome does not have many department stores. The closest to the city centre is the Galleria Alberto Sordi, on Via del Corso, near the Piazza Colonna. It opens every day from 10 am to 10 pm. Street markets Rome has several very interesting street markets full of traditional products, art, clothes and antiques: Porta Portese Market : Only open on Sunday mornings, this traditional flea market that sells from books to clothes to CDs is Rome\u2019s largest street market. It is spread throughout the streets of Trastevere Railway Station. Mercato dei Fiori : This market is open every morning and mainly sells flowers, vegetables and fruit. It is located in the Campo dei Fiori and is very charming. Piazza Fontanella Borghese Market : It opens every morning except Sundays and specializes in books and antiques. Visitors will find it near the Piazza di Spagna. Via Sannio Market : Five minutes from San Giovanni metro station is located Via Sannio Market. It\u00a0opens on weekdays until 8 pm (approximately).

See Trajan's Column up-close Trajan's Column is almost 40 metres high. Its\u00a0spiral bas-reliefs narrate in detail the unforgettable chapter of history in which the Roman Empire defeated the Dacians as if it were an open book. Originally, the more than 2,500 figures on Trajan's Column were decorated with bright colours, making it look even more magnificent. More than 50 of the figures depicted Trajan , the architect of the Roman people's victory over the Dacians. The depictions were particularly useful for those who could not read, vividly conveying the triumphant episode of the battle, allowing the populace to witness the might of Rome under the leadership of Trajan . At the time of its construction, the column was located inside Trajan's Market , but over the centuries, the imposing market fell into disrepair and a large part of the installations were lost, leaving the majestic column outside the complex. Despite the passing of\u00a0almost 2000 years , Trajan's Column stands firm and in perfect condition to remain part of Rome's eternity while continuing to tell its stories to visitors who come to see it.

By plane Rome has\u00a0two international airports with over 40 million passengers passing through the city every year. Traveling from the U.S. Visitors flying from the United States will find direct flights to Rome from New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Traveling from Canada Compared to the U.S., it's a little more difficult to find direct flights from Canada to Rome. However, there are flights from Toronto. Traveling from Australia Australia\u2019s main cities offer flights to Rome with one or more stops: Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Melbourne and Perth. Traveling from Europe If you live in Europe, it is now possible to visit the Italian capital for less than \u20ac 50 . Flight search engine -\u00a0Find and compare cheap flights online Once you have your ticket and know which airport you land in, find out how to get to the centre of Rome from Leonardo da Vinci Airport or Ciampino Airport: Rome Fiumicino Airport Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is the largest airport in Rome and Italy. Its official name is Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci. Rome Ciampino Airport The Rome-Ciampino Airport (CIA) is the second most important airport in Rome. It is 7.5 miles from the centre and moves nearly 6 million passengers a year. Boat If you're coming from the Citavecchi port, you have three options: Take a day trip : This is the best way to see Rome in a day and to be sure to see the best of Rome in one day, and guarantee to be at the boat on time to embark. We offer an excursion to Rome from Civitavecchia with an English-speaking guide, and skip-the-line entry to St. Peter's Basilica. Reserve transport only : The price of the return transport from the port to the centre of Rome is \u20ac 25 per person, and it guarantees return in time for embarkment. Take a train : This is the cheapest, but least recommendable option. You'll have to walk to the Citiavecchia station, suffer an hour train ride, then take another means of transport once you arrive at the Termini train station. Train If you\u2019re planning on discovering Italy and visiting other cities, the train is an excellent option to keep in mind. The high-speed trains, called Frecciarossa, connect Rome and Florence in a little over an hour and a half and to Milan in three hours. There are also other categories of trains called Frecciargento or Frecciabianca, which also connect Rome with most cities in the country, but are slower. If you\u2019re touring Europe and would like to get to Rome by train, the easiest option is to get to Milan and from there take a train to Milan, You can check schedules and fares and even book online on the Ferrovie dello Stato website. Another option to arrive in Rome is to take the train from Naples . It's a great way to save money\u00a0and even gets you closer to Pompeii. Rome Termini Railway Station Termini Station is Rome\u2019s main railway station. Every day 480,000 travellers pass through its platforms, making it the busiest train station in Italy. Car If you\u2019d like to tour Europe by car and are thinking of getting to Rome by this means of transport, we recommend a stopover in Monaco, Genoa, Pisa and Florence, for example. Otherwise, the drive can be exhausting.

        "text":"Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) - History of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Roman Republic (509 BC - 27 BC) The Roman Republic was installed after the Roman kingdom was overthrown in 509 BC and lasted until 27 BC . One of the most important figures of this period is Julius Caesar . According to tradition, in 509 BC a series of essential events took place in the history of Rome : the last monarch was expelled, Rome was taken by Porsenna's army , the treaty between Rome and Carthage was signed, the Consular Fasti began and the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated . It seems like a lot of events for such a short time. The only one that belongs with certainty to the year 509 BC is the dedication of the temple of Jupiter. The other events may have taken place later, albeit within a short period of time. The Fasti consulares\u00a0(documents with the names of the consuls or magistrates that described the main events of the period) are essential for\u00a0understanding the Roman Republic from 503 BC, from when they are considered credible. Another very important method used to understand this period of Roman history is the ritual of the clavus annalis . This practice\u00a0began one year after the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated and it consisted in fixing a bronze nail to the right of the altar once a year. The first nail was placed in 508 BC. The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus had the cella of Jupiter, as well as the cella of Minerva and Juno. The decade after 509 BC (the year when the last King of Rome was dethroned, while he was away from Rome) is a dark period and very little is known, only isolated events. Transition\u00a0to the Roman Republic The transition of Rome from a monarchy to a republic led to severe internal social tensions . This lack of control over the city led neighbouring tribes to siege the city and reduce its power. This is why Rome had to ratify its identity on numerous occasions during the first 70 years of the Republic. The early years of the Republic are of political turmoil. The population was divided, certain wanted a monarchy, others a republic, others favoured the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, and others wanted to form part of the Latin civilisation. The nobles who had overthrown the king and his family had not come to an agreement regarding the type of government that would replace the monarchy. The consuls, which would later replace the leadership of the Roman kings, were\u00a0not put in place immediately, but many years later. Many historians believe that in the first stages of the Roman Republic, a praetor maximus was appointed for one year only. Later his duties would be split in two by choosing two consuls at a time to govern Rome. This form of government went on until 449 BC, with the Valeria Horaria law. The position of chief magistrate was not exclusively for the \u201c patres \u201d, who formed the Roman senate, and controlled the army and the priests since the time of Romulus , as there is evidence that shows plebeians, common civilians, becoming consuls up until 485 BC. The political instability led the strongest factions to form alliances between themselves. From 485 BC, the patricians no longer allowed commoners to take part in the government and began to control all civil and religious matters. Roman Law As well as the constant rivalry between patricians and plebeians, the Republic is also known as a period in which the power of Rome reached the whole peninsula of Italy and Roman law was founded\u00a0with the Law of the Twelve Tables in 450 BC. Moreover, it was\u00a0also a period when many wars took place for equality between the Roman inhabitants. The Twelve Tables\u00a0were written up to appease the demands of the commoners. Until the Tables were written, Roman law had had a sacred character, as it had been linked to the monarchy and the college of pontiffs. With its drafting, Roman law was desacralised and became the basis of the law of the Western world. According to the historian Titus Livy, the Twelve Tables were the source of all Roman law, both public and private . Between the years 133 BC and 27 BC, Rome suffered from great internal tensions, leading to numerous civil wars. The Graco brothers, who proposed a series of laws in favour of the plebeians, also led to a social crisis in Rome. Dictatorship: Transition from the Republic to the Roman Empire The big step towards a political system in which power was accumulated in the hands of a single person was taken by Sulla (dictator in the years 82-79) . Sulla's systematisation was very important and one of the consequences, which greatly influenced politics and the very end of the Republic, was the fact that he concentrated all political power in the hands of the Senate, which was not the case with the executive government . This meant that the Senate had to entrust the executive to a natural-born leader, a general who was also a politician. At the same time, the Populares also wanted to occupy power, leading to a strengthening of personal power in governing. The strengthening of personalism led to the triumvirate and the dictatorships of Julius Caesar or Augustus\u00a0and marked the end of the Republic and the beginning of a new era, the Empire .

The temple is famous since it houses the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden figure of the Child Jesus, which is said to be miraculous. History Located south of the Capitoline Hill, Santa Maria in Aracoeli was built during the sixth century on the site of an ancient Byzantine abbey. During the ninth century\u00a0the church was given to the Benedictines, and a few centuries later, was given to the Franciscans. These restored the church giving it a more Gothic aspect. In 1797, during the Republic, the church was deconsecrated and\u00a0transformed into a stable. Nowadays, the basilica has been fully reconstructed and is one of the most visited in Rome. The interior Millions of tourists and locals visit the church to see the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, a wooden image of the Christ Child, who is believed to resurrect the dead. The statue, made out of olive wood during the fifteenth century, was stolen in 1994 and was never recovered. A replica was made to substitute it. The temple has 22 columns, none exactly alike, which were taken from Roman ruins.\u00a0It is also worth seeing various burials and frescoes from the fifteenth century. The wooden ceiling is decorated with paintings representing the Battle of Lepanto, where the Holy League defeated the fleet of the Ottoman Empire. Aracoeli staircase The Aracoeli staircase was completed in 1348 to celebrate the end of the Black Death in Rome. It is a marble staircase made up of 124 steep steps that finish at the entrance of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. It is believed that all those who climb the stairs on their knees will win the lottery. In the heart of the city The Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli is extremely well located, in the heart of the city, near the Altare della Patria .\u00a0Therefore, stopping for a quick visit is very popular among visitors.

Book this guided tour Palatine Hill is considered to be the birthplace of the Italian capital and is believed to have been inhabited since the year 1000 B.C . During the Republican Period, Roman citizens belonging to the upper class settled in Palatine Hill and built sumptuous palaces , of which important traces are still preserved. According to the legend Roman mythology talks of the cave that was inhabited by Luperca, the she-wolf that took care of Romulus and Remus , which is located on Palatine Hill . According to the legend, when the brothers grew up they decided to form a city on the banks of the river, but when they could not come to an agreement on some points of the decision, Romulus killed Remus and founded the city of Rome . What to see on Palatine Hill On Palatine Hill, you can see hundreds of ruins of imposing buildings that were created for high Roman society in ancient times. Although the whole scene is impressive, these are some of the points that deserve special attention : Domus Flavia : The splendid palace Domus Flavia was built in the year 81 B.C . by the order of Emperor Domitian as a public and official residence. There are still some parts of the extensive construction that can be seen. House of Livia : This modestly-built house which was built in the 1st century B.C. is one of the best-preserved buildings in Palatine Hill. It's still possible to glimpse the remains of the mosaics and frescoes that at one time cheered up the ceilings and walls. House of Augustus : Built as the private residence of Octavian Augustus, the house built on two levels still has a large part of the valued and colorful frescoes that decorated its walls. Farnese Gardens : Designed in the middle of the 16th century on the ruins of the Palace of Tiberius, the Farnese Gardens were one of the first botanical gardens to be created in Europe. Hippodrome of Domitian : Given the appearance of a Roman circus, it's not known for certain if the stadium was created for holding races, or just to be used as a garden. Palatine museum : In this small museum, several discoveries that were made during excavations carried out on Palatine Hill are on exhibition. There are sculptures, frescoes, mosaics, and other objects belonging to the golden age of Palatine Hill. From Palatine Hill, you can get the best views of the Roman Forum from above . A walk in Ancient Rome Palatine Hill is a very pleasant place for a quiet stroll under the shadow of the trees while passing many of the preserved corners of ancient Rome. It's worth dedicating half a day to visit it since the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill each cover a very large space that should be very interesting . Guided Visits to Skip the Lines The best way to visit while skipping the lines is to reserve our tour , visiting the three main monuments in the city: Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill - all with a specialist guide. If you prefer visiting at your own pace, we recommend arriving first thing in the morning to visit the Vatican . This way you can hopefully avoid longer lines.

Established by Pope Julius II during the sixteenth century, it houses thousands of works of art. Book a tour The origins of these museums go back to 1503 , the year in which the recently named Pope Julius II donated his private collection. Since that moment private families and other popes have enlarged the collection of the museums to the point where it has become one of the largest in the world . At present, the Vatican Museums receive more than 6 million visitors annually , partly due to the fact\u00a0that they form the entrance to the Sistine Chapel . What museums are there in the interior? Pio-Clementino Museum : Created thanks to the popes Clement XIV and Pius VI, this museum holds the most important Greek works in the Vatican. Apartment of Pius V : The work of Pope Pius V, this museum contains Flemish tapestries from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a collection of medieval ceramics, and another of medieval miniature mosaics. Gallery of the Chandeliers : Roman replicas of Greek originals and enormous chandeliers from the second century A.D. decorate this elegant gallery. Ethnological Missionary Museum : This museum contains works of art from all the papal missions of the world, among which there are objects originating from Tibet, Indonesia, India, the Far East, Africa, and America. Gallery of Maps : Carried out between the years 1580 and 1585, the beautiful maps painted in fresco on the walls of this gallery represent the Italian regions and the possessions of the Church. Historical Museum - Carriage Pavilion : In this section, you'll find coaches, saddles, cars, and even Vatican City's first locomotive. Gallery of Tapestries : Exhibition of Flemish tapestries created between 1523 and 1534. Pio-Christian Museum : The collection of Christian antiquities is composed of statues, sarcophagi, and archaeological ruins from the sixth century. Pinacoteca : The eighteen rooms in the Pinacoteca building contain pictorial works dating from the Middle Ages until 1800. Sobieski Room and the Room of the Immaculate : In both rooms, you'll find paintings originating in the Italian \"Ottocento\". Egyptian Museum : Among other pieces acquired by the popes you can find some impressive Egyptian sculptures, besides the prized sarcophagi from the third century B.C. There are also some black basalt statues originating from the Villa Adriana , which are replicas of Egyptian models. Etruscan museum : This part of the museum contains elements of ceramic, bronze, and gold belonging to the Etruscan civilization. Chiaramonti Museum : Created thanks to Pius VII Chiaramonti, this gallery holds thousands of sculptures including portraits of emperors, images of the gods, and some funeral monuments. Gregorian Profane Museum : Its rooms hold Greek and Roman sculptures from the first to third centuries A.D. Borgia Apartment : The apartments that belonged to Pope Alexander VI Borgia today serve as exhibition rooms for the Collection of Modern Religious Art. Raphael Rooms : Rafael and his assistants decorated the apartments of Pope Julius II with unparalleled taste. Sala Della Biga : A monumental figure of marble of a chariot drawn by two horses carried out in the first century A.D. fills the space and gives the room its name. Skip the lines The queue to enter the Vatican Museums is undoubtedly the longest in Rome. We could say that, of all Europe, the Eiffel Tower is the only monument that can compete with them. The other way to avoid the lines is to book an English-speaking\u00a0guided tour of the Vatican . This way you'll see the most interesting landmarks and learn about the fascinating history of the Vatican City, as you follow your guide straight in without having to queue. If you prefer to visit on your own, we recommend avoiding a visit on the last Sunday of each month (the free day) and during the Easter holiday . It is also advisable to avoid weekends, especially in high season. In our experience, the best time to go is on weekdays at 1\u00a0pm . Most people tend to come first thing in the morning to avoid the lines, so this is often the time when you'll have to wait the longest. In our experience, the best time to go is around 13:00 on weekdays, as most people tend to crowd in early in the morning to avoid the queues.

The exhibits The Palazzo Altemps houses an important collection of Greek and Roman sculpture that belonged to several families of the Roman nobility between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The works are on display in beautiful rooms decorated with frescoes on the walls and ceilings. The figures belonging to the Altemps Collection are also on display in the lovely patio and next to the monumental staircase. Although Cardinal Altemps\u2019s collection includes over 100 works, many of them are displayed in other museums, such as the Louvre. The Boncompagni Ludovisi collection spans most of the museum. It consists of more than 100 works, including The Galatian Suicide and the remarkable Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus. The palace also displays a major collection of Egyptian art, as well as collections that belonged to the Mattei and Del Drago families. Perhaps one of the most striking parts of the museum is the Church of San Aniceto, a small and pleasant church located within the building. A mandatory visit The Palazzo Altemps is one of the best museums in Rome , and it has the added advantage of its entry fee being included with that of the other branches of the National Museum of Rome.

Built in the neighbourhood of Trastevere on the orders of a banker from Siena, the villa owes its name to its subsequent owner, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Touring Villa Farnesina The building consists of a central block, two small wings, and two floors. The interior of the villa is surprisingly richly decorated with frescoes by major artists, such as Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and Peruzzi . On the first floor there are particularly striking frescoes of the Sala di Galatea, one of Raphael\u2019s most important works. When observing the ceiling, one can see astrological paintings showing the position of the stars on the day of the birth of Chigi, the villa\u2019s first owner. On the upper floor there is another one of the villa\u2019s most beautiful rooms, the Sala delle Prospettive. The room\u2019s d\u00e9cor is based on the optical illusion created by the frescoes that show the city of Rome through the marble columns . Remarkable decor Villa Farnesina is an important manifestation of the luxury and opulence that predominated in Italian society during the Renaissance period . Although the building is of unremarkable size and its exterior is not particularly striking , the reason for visiting lies in the frescoes that cover the ceilings and walls that decorate the interior of the villa. Comparisons are odious, and the paintings of Villa Farnesina are excellent, but they are of little interest when compared to the Borghese Gallery , a\u00a0beautifully decorated building that also houses different works of art.

        "text":"Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - The ancient church in Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore The Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore is an ancient Catholic basilica that is considered to be the largest of the churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Rome. It is one of the city\u2019s four major basilicas. Going back in time Built on a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Cybele, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore was built in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Pope Liberius. According to legend, the Virgin appeared before the Pope with the instructions for building the church, and the shape of the floor was designed based on a miraculous snowfall. Over the years, the basilica has had many different names, such as Saint Mary of the Snow (due to snow that led to the church\u2019s shape), Santa Maria Liberiana (for Pope Liberius), St. Mary of the Nativity (because it received a relic of the Holy Nativity), and it was finally called Santa Maria Maggiore, as it is the largest of the 26 churches in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Inside The basilica displays varied architectural styles, from early Christian to Baroque. The entire building was restored and renovated during the eighteenth century, so the facade and much of the interior date from that period. Despite this, the church retains the bell tower, some mosaics and marble floors from the medieval period and some Ionic columns from other ancient Roman buildings, as well as splendid fifth-century mosaics. The ceiling decoration has been preserved from the Renaissance period, while the domes and chapels belong to the Baroque era. A successful mix of styles Probably the most striking aspect of the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore is the different parts belonging to such varied periods of history. As if it were made up of remnants, the church summarizes the most important stages of Christian art in Rome.

        "text":"Romulus and Remus - The founding of Rome Civitatis Rome General Information History Romulus and Remus There are several fascinating legends and myths about how the city of Rome was founded, all collected by the Italian historian, Tito Livio . The Legend of Romulus and Remus Legend has it that Ascanio, son of the Trojan hero\u00a0Aeneas (son of Venus and Anchises), founded the city of Alba Longa on the right bank of the river Tiber. Many of Aeneas' descendants\u00a0reigned this settlement peacefully. When Nimitor was king, his brother Amulius seized power\u00a0and dethroned Nimitor, killing his male heirs and forcing his daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin so that she would not provide a male heir to the throne. Nevertheless, Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins, Romulus and Remus, whose father was thought to be Mars, the god of War. Amulius imprisoned the daughter and condemned the babies to death by drowning in the river Tiber. However, the servant in charge of the task took pity on them and instead placed the twins into a basket and pushed them down the River Tiber. They were safely carried to the area of the seven hills. There, the boys were found by a she-wolf called Lupa who nursed them in her lair in Palatine Hill until they were found by a shepherd and his wife, who raised them as shepherds. As adults, Romulus and Remus were two natural-born\u00a0leaders and in a fight killed King Amulius and reinstated Nimitor as king of Alba Longa. Seeking to establish their own settlement, Romulus finally built a wall around Palatine Hill, the location he had chosen for the founding of Rome. The she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus is said to have been their human foster mother . The term wolf, in Latin lupa, was also used,\u00a0in a derogatory sense, for the prostitutes of the time. When seeking the perfect location for their new city, the twins wandered across the seven hills (Aventine, Celio, Capitol, Esquiline, Palatine , Quirinal and Viminal). Remus wished to start the city on Aventine Hill, while Romulus preferred Palatine Hill . In order to decide which brother was right\u00a0they agreed to consult augury, where birds are examined to see what the gods favoured. Remus claimed to have seen six birds, whereas his brother had seen twelve. Even though Romulus had seen more birds, Remus argued that he had seen them first and therefore the city should be built on the Aventine Hill. Meanwhile, Romulus began to build a wall on his hill, which Remus decided to jump over. Angered by his brother\u2019s action, Romulus killed him . According to the legend, this took place in 754 BC. The Legend of Aeneas According to another legend, the Trojan prince, Aeneas, reached the Italian coast and married Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus, thus becoming king . This myth is not only told by Greek historians, but is defended in Italy compared to other legends that give Rome an Arcadian origin, related to the myth of Evandro, or Achaean, related to Odysseus or Ulysses. The myth of Aeneas gives Rome a divine and Greek founding . However, the tradition of a Trojan origin of Rome cannot be considered admissible if you compare\u00a0the date of the destruction of Troy (1200 BC) with the archaeological remains of the settlement of Latium and Septimontium, similar to many other Late Bronze Age settlements in Italy and far from being a major settlement, let alone a city.

        "text":"Roman Forum - Opening hours, tickets and how to get there \u2013 Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Tourist Attractions Roman Forum Located between Piazza Venezia and the Colosseum, the Roman Forum was the hub\u00a0of political and social activity of the Roman citizens. Book a Tour The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place . The Forum is, along with the Colosseum , the greatest sign of the splendor of the Roman Empire that can be seen today. After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that excavations were carried out. Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima , one of the first sewer systems in the world. Points of interest Besides the great number of temples that are in the forum (Saturn, Venus, Romulus, Vesta, etc.), it's worth paying special attention to the following points of interest: Via Sacra : This was the main street in ancient Rome that linked the Piazza del Campidoglio with the Colosseum. Arch of Titus : This is a triumphal arch that commemorates Rome's victory over Jerusalem. It was built after the death of the emperor Titus. Arch of Septimius Severus : An arch erected in the year 203 A.D. to commemorate the third anniversary of Septimius Severus as the emperor. Temple of Antoninus and Faustina : Built in the second century, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina sets itself apart as the best-preserved temple in the Roman Forum. Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine : Though now mostly destroyed, its size suggests that this was one of the most important buildings of the Roman Forum. The Curia : In this building, the Senate met to make administrative decisions about the Roman government. Column of Phocas : Erected in the year 608 A.D. in honor of the emperor of Byzantium, this column, which is over 13 meters high,\u00a0is one of the few that have remained standing since being built. A must-see Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower . As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there . The Roman Forum is one of the most beautiful and interesting places in the city, making it easy to spend hours strolling through its various temples without getting bored. Skip the Lines The best way to skip the line and get to know the Forum in detail is to take a guided tour . We'll visit three of the main monuments in the city, the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill, skipping the line, and all with an expert guide. If you prefer to discover it on your own, we recommend that you head first thing in the morning, as this is when people head to visit the Vatican .

Hail cabs that have a telephone number written on the sides of the vehicle, which means that they work for a taxi company. If you have any problem, write down the taxi\u2019s license plate number (it is always at the back of the front seat) and call the taxi company. If at any point you think you are being swindled, don\u2019t let the taxi driver intimidate you and call the Carabinieri. Additionally, it is always a good idea to ask for a receipt and complain to the taxi company. Taxi companies Although the cheapest way to catch a cab is by waiting at the official taxi stops on the streets of Rome, it is also possible to reserve this type of transportation by telephone. These are some of the best taxi companies in the city: Radio Taxi : 06-3570. Pronto Taxi : 06-6645. Other companies: 06-5551, 06-4994, 06-4157.

Erected between 1568 and 1584, Il Ges\u00f9 was the first Jesuit church built in Rome. It was lavishly decorated during the seventeenth century. Nowadays, the Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Chiesa del Ges\u00f9) is considered to be one of the best examples of Roman Baroque architecture. In its interior Il Ges\u00fa was built with small chapels instead of aisles, designed specially so that the members of the church are all facing the main altar. One of the most striking parts of the temple\u00a0is the ceiling fresco painted by Baciccia (Giovanni Battista Gaulli). The fresco manages to look three-dimensional thanks to the wooden figures and stuccos added to the fresco. Located in the chapel of the Madonna della Strada there is a small icon of the Madonna della Strada. The icon was built on the same site as Il Ges\u00f9 and dates from the fifteenth century. It had originally been part of the church, which has the same name. The Chapel St Ignatius of Loyola (founder of the Jesuits) is a prime example of Roman Baroque architecture. In this chapel, the tomb of the saint is decorated with silver, gold, bronze, marble and some special stones. In the right transept\u00a0is the altar of Saint Francis Xavier, one of the founders of the Jesuits. The altar features Jesus with St Ignatius and it has a silver reliquary with part of the saint\u2019s right arm. In the heart of the city Il Ges\u00f9 is not one of the most impressive churches in Rome, but its decoration and chapels are interesting to see.

The Piazza della Repubblica is made up of a large roundabout with an exquisite fountain, surrounded by imposing buildings on one side and a seemingly demolished temple on the other. It was formerly known as the Piazza dell'Esedra because it was laid down on the remains of an exedra (a semi-circular open room with seating) from the Diocletian era. Fontana delle Naiadi At the centre of the Piazza della Repubblica stands the majestic Fontana delle Naiadi . It was constructed between 1870 and 1888 and decorated with four lion sculptures. In 1901 the lions were replaced by the statues of four nude Naiads (water nymphs). Their nudity was subject of much controversy at the time.

        "text":"Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls - Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls Erected during the fourth century AD, the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls (Basilica di San Paolo Fuori le Mura) is one of the four major basilicas of Rome, and the second largest after St. Peter's Basilica . It was founded on the burial ground of St. Paul. Architecture When Paul the Apostle was executed in the first century AD in Rome, his followers built a shrine over his grave. In 324 a small church was consecrated on the same grounds, which was later demolished in 386 to make space for the construction of a larger and more beautiful basilica, completed in 395. The monastery\u2019s striking cloister was built between 1220 and 1241. The cloister is\u00a0one of the few parts of the Basilica which survived the fire of 1823. After the fire, many countries made donations for the restoration of the church, which was reopened in 1840. The temple was later declared a national monument. Interior The interior of the Basilica of St. Paul is magnificent, with enormous marble columns and beautiful gold mosaics. Unfortunately, because of the fire of 1823, few parts of the Medieval basilica remain intact. However, the church still houses some mosaics from the thirteenth century, a large twelfth-century chandelier, and the marble tombstone under which the remains of St. Paul lie. On the basilica\u2019s walls, visitors will be able to observe the portraits of each of the popes, while a ray of sunlight lights up the portrait of the current Pope, Pope Francis. The atrium located in the exterior is one of the most noteworthy parts of the church. It is made up of 150 columns, and from here, visitors can see the fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica covered by an enormous golden mosaic built between 1854 and 1874, which\u00a0reflects the rays of sunlight. The centre of the portico houses a colossal statue of St. Paul. A little far away, but a must-see Although the Basilica isn\u2019t in the heart of the city, we recommend visiting this unique and astonishing church in order to see its impressive mosaics, atrium and interior. It is one of the best churches in\u00a0Rome.

Rome in summer July is the hottest month of the year in Rome, although August is nearly as hot, with average temperatures of 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Due to the high humidity, visiting the city during these months can be a little stifling. In August, many shops close and many locals leave on vacation. The Best Time of Year to Visit Rome The city of Rome can be discovered the whole year round . However, if you can, we recommend going in spring or\u00a0autumn, when there are normally fewer\u00a0hordes of tourists. However, if you don\u2019t like large crowds, avoid visiting the city during Easter as this is when Rome has the largest amount of travellers. In autumn, it is more likely to rain than in spring. Language Public Holidays You may also be interested in Language Although the official language spoken in Rome\u00a0is Italian, travellers will find that many locals speak English, especially those who work in restaurants, hotels\u00a0and other places associated with tourism. Public Holidays It\u2019s always interesting to find out the public holidays of the place you\u2019re travelling to beforehand. This allows you to make the most of holidays\u00a0and also gives you an idea of when museums and other places of interest are closed.

        "text":"Santa Maria del Popolo - Opening hours and entrance \u2013 Rome Civitatis Rome Things to do Churches and Basilicas Santa Maria del Popolo Standing on the Piazza del Popolo , near the northern gate of the Aurelian Wall, the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo is a small temple with splendid Renaissance decoration in its interior. Its origins The origins of the basilica are very unusual. A legend had it that the site where the church was eventually erected\u00a0was haunted by the ghost of Nero, a Roman Emperor who reigned from 54 to 68 AD. On his burial ground had grown a bewitched walnut tree full of crows. To put an end to this myth, Pope Paschal II in 1099 ordered the tree to be cut down and commissioned a Romanesque chapel to be built instead. The chapel was enlarged in 1227 and later reconstructed between 1472 and 1477. In 1513, various of the most influential artists of the period, like Pinturicchio, Raphael, Caravaggio and Bernini were requested to decorate the walls and ceilings of the temple. In its interior Santa Maria del Popolo\u2019s decoration is unlike any other church in Rome . The ceiling, less high than most built during the same period, is practically bare, while the decoration of each of the small chapels is especially remarkable. Among the beautiful artwork found in the church, it is worth highlighting the Chapel Cerasi, which houses two canvases by Caravaggio from 1600, and the Chapel Chigi, built and decorated by Raphael. If you look closely at the wooden benches, you\u2019ll be able to see inscriptions with the names of the people the benches\u00a0are dedicated to. This custom is also found in a lot of English-speaking countries like Scotland or\u00a0Edinburgh, where the families of the person deceased buy urban furniture in their honour. Not like any other church in Rome In Rome\u00a0it is possible to visit an infinite number of churches, therefore it is worth reading a little about each church and selecting a few that appear most appealing to you, so\u00a0as not to visit too many. The Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo is one of those that are definitely worth visiting, not because of its structure or its fa\u00e7ade, but because of its impressively decorated chapels.

History The Piazza Campo dei Fiori, which was once a field of flowers, and thus the name, was paved in 1456 under Pope Callistus III. Thanks to the prominent buildings surrounding the piazza, such as Palazzo Orsini , the Campo de\u2019 Fiori became a very popular part of Rome frequented by the most influential historical figures. Its popularity drew new businesses to the area, opening workshops, inns and taverns making this neighborhood one of the most prosperous of the city. Moreover, Campo de\u2019 Fiori was the location where a horse market took place twice a week. Public executions took place in this square , which is nowadays commemorated by the impressive statue of Giordano Bruno, in the centre of the piazza. The Italian philosopher was burnt at the stake in 1600 for heresy. The monument was built in his honour in 1889. Twenty-first century Campo de\u2019 Fiori The Campo de\u2019 Fiori is currently one of the most beloved parts of the city . Since 1869, every morning from Monday through Saturday it houses a market well-known for its flowers and fruit and vegetable.

It's known as much for its decoration, as for being the temple in which popes are chosen and crowned. The construction of the building was carried out between 1473 and 1481 during the mandate of Pope Sixtus IV , to whom it owes its current name. The architect responsible for the construction was Giovanni of Dolci and it's the only work that he is remembered for. The most striking thing about\u00a0the Sistine Chapel is not its architecture, but the frescoes that completely cover the walls and the ceiling. Some of the most important artists who worked in the chapel are Botticelli, Perugino, Luca, and Michelangelo . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel All of the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are the work of Michelangelo , who spent four years painting the vault between 1508 and 1512. If there is one thing that stands out from among the images on the ceiling, it's the nine stories from Genesis that occupy the central area : The scenes from the Drunkenness of Noah to the Separation of Light from Darkness are represented. The Creation of Adam Without any doubt, The Creation of Adam is the best-known image from the Sistine Chapel . It's located in the central part of the vault and represents the story from Genesis in which God gives life to Adam. The Final Judgment Located over the high altar and with some magnificent dimensions (13.7 by 12.2 meters), Michelangelo\u2019s other masterpiece , The Final Judgment, is found. It's a fresco that represents the Apocalypse of St. John. Decorating the apse occupied five years of Michelangelo\u2019s life, between 1536 and 1541 . It was an assignment of Pope Paul III to cover the murals that existed to that point. Skip the lines If you're visiting the Sistine Chapel, you'll have to visit the Vatican museums, the most popular attraction in Rome and Europe. The best way to do this is to take a combo tour that takes in the\u00a0Basilica, Vatican Museums, and the Sistine Chapel, with a local guide, we recommend reserving a guided tour of the Vatican so you can make the most of the attraction. If you hope to visit on your own, the best time is to go at 1 pm . We don't recommend going on the first Sunday of the month (when it's free) or over Easter .

The mansion houses valuable works by great masters such as Raphael , Tiziano , Caravaggio , Brueghel the Elder , Velazquez and Bernini . The Exhibitions The Galleria Doria Pamphilj collection was started by Pope Innocent X Pamphilj in 1644. It currently consists of over 400 paintings dating from the 15th to the 18th century . Oddly, the paintings are in an order that has not changed over the course of time . This can be proven through an\u00a018th-century document that details the exact placement of each one of the paintings. One of the most noteworthy works in the gallery is the Portrait of Pope Innocent X , by Vel\u00e1zquez , which shows the pope exactly as he was : an ominous and distrustful man . This led to a great deal of controversy at the time of its painting, given that other artists purported to idealize the pontiff\u2019s characteristics in order to soften his sinister visage. Despite the painting\u2019s realism, the Pamphilj family keeps it in a special place, and it has had its own room since the 19th century. In addition to the full gallery, within the palace, you can also visit a small chapel and several private rooms that maintain their original decor and part of their furniture . Not Worth Visiting The Palazzo Doria Pamphilj maintains a good deal of its original decor and showcases a large amount of artwork. Nevertheless, the entry fee is too expensive relative to the quality of the exhibits . Rome has important galleries that are superior to the Galleria Pamphilj.

Interesting facts The name Cosmedin comes from the Greek word \u201ckosmidion\u201d, meaning ornamented, thanks to its beautifully decorated interior. Nowadays, the church is practically bare, although it still has some magnificent elements such as the floor mosaics,\u00a0the bishop\u2019s chair, the baldachin and the medieval choir enclosure. Another treasure worth discovering is the glass shrine with the skull of St Valentine, patron saint of love, located on the left side of the church. The restored Medieval fa\u00e7ade has a portico with seven arches, in which\u00a0visitors queue to place their hand in the mouth of the legendary Bocca della Verit\u00e0 (Mouth of Truth). Legend has it that if a person places his or her hand in the mouth of the statue and lies, the mouth will close and cut their hand off. Next to the church\u2019s porch is an impressive Romanesque bell tower built during the twelfth century. Crypt The crypt, constructed in the eighth century, is located beneath the altar and was built to store the relics taken from the catacombs by Pope Adrian I. The crypt is shaped like a small basilica. The side walls have several niches, each with shelves made of marble, where the different relics are displayed.

Don't miss visiting the forced perspective gallery by Francesco Borromini. Galer\u00eda Spada Collection of the Galleria Spada 2 See photo gallery Located in an exquisite palazzo built in the mid-sixteenth century, the Galleria Spada houses a small collection of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The most fascinating part of the mansion is the forced perspective gallery by Borromini. Exhibitions The collection, largely assembled by Cardinal Bernardino Spada, is made up of different pieces of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Spada family was deeply interested in collecting and promoting the art of the period. One of the gallery\u2019s main attractions is found in the courtyard. The Italian artist Francesco Borromini created the forced perspective gallery, a gallery measuring 9 metres long. However,\u00a0thanks to an architectural trick, it creates a visual optical illusion of a 40 metre gallery. As the walls of the room narrow, the floor rises and the height decreases so that the small sculpture which is placed at the end of the gallery seems larger. The collection is divided into four halls, as they would be during the seventeenth century, with the small paintings hung on the top floor and the larger pictures placed on the ground floor. It gives the impression that the paintings are hung in a strange order. For a second visit to Rome Although Borromini\u2019s forced perspective gallery is rather impressive, especially for the period, we recommend visiting other museums before Galleria Spada. This could be a good option for a second visit to Rome.

The Ara Pacis is an altar located in the interior of a closed structure carved in Carrara marble. It\u00a0stands out because of its impressive decoration made up of various reliefs showing the family of Augustus in procession, in addition to different allegories related to the mythical foundation of Rome. Ara Pacis in the past Erected in the Campus Martius, the monument was dedicated to the Roman goddess of Peace. Each year, a ram and two oxen were sacrificed in the goddess's honor. The altar was located in such a way that the shadow of the great obelisk located in the Campus Martius was projected on the Ara Pacis on the birthday of Augustus. Due to the expansion of the river,\u00a0the altar was submerged in mud, where it remained for more than one millennium. It was not until the 16th century that some of the remains were found and in 1938 its reconstruction was carried out, preserving it until the present day. Ara Pacis today Although the Ara Pacis is one of the most significant monuments of Ancient Rome, it's the only thing that is exhibited in the interior of the museum, making an entrance ticket quite expensive. It's best to look at the altar from the outside, as the building that contains it is made of glass. Ara Pacis Altar of Augustan Peace 2 See photo gallery Location Lungotevere en Augusta.

Book this guided tour A little history Construction of the building began in the year 135 under the direction of the Emperor Hadrian , who intended to use it as mausoleum for himself and his family . It was finished in the year 139 and a short time later, it became a military building, which in the year 403 would be integrated to the Aurelian Walls. In the year 590, while a great epidemic of plague devastated the city, the Pope Gregory I had a vision of Saint Michael the Archangel on top of the castle, announcing the end of the epidemic. In memory of the apparition the building is crowned with a statue of an angel. In the year 1277 an 800 metre fortified corridor was built that connected the castle with the Vatican City so that the Pope could escape in the event that he were in danger. During the sieges that occurred in Rome during 1527, the Pope Clement VII used the fortress as a refuge . The castle today The Castel Sant'Angelo is split into five floors which can be reached by a spiral ramp that first reaches the chamber of ashes and subsequently the cells in which a number of historical figures were incarcerated . Advancing toward the upper part of the castle you will find different rooms that functioned as a Papal residence , decorated with perfectly preserved frescoes from the Renaissance period , besides the extensive collection of weapons .

        "text":"Pompeii - Review, opening hours & how to get there Civitatis Rome Things to do Day Trips from Rome Pompeii Pompeii was an ancient Roman city near modern Naples that was buried by the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Book a Day Trip Pompeii was the ancient city of Rome that was totally destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD. Since it was engulfed so quickly by a wall of volcanic mud, the city is extremely well preserved. Pompeii still has most of its buildings, streets, and even the volcano\u2019s victims who died instantly and are preserved in ash. The Tragic Story of Pompeii The city is believed to have been founded by the Osci or the Oscans during the seventh century BC. Over the years the city prospered and grew with villas, monuments, and gardens. Pompeii was thriving when in 62 AD it was hit by a severe earthquake, damaging the city. While the city\u2019s inhabitants were still reconstructing the city after the earthquake, as it's believed that almost all the buildings had been affected, in 79 AD\u00a0a tragic event that would annihilate the town completely took place.\u00a0On 24 August, Mount Vesuvius erupted covering Pompeii in ash. On the following morning, a river of volcanic mud enveloped the city. The remains lay forgotten until they were rediscovered in the sixteenth century. Excavations of Pompeii began in 1748 and over 45 hectares have since been unearthed. What to see Pompeii is very large, and tourists can visit numerous buildings in which residents went about their everyday lives, including some temples, the basilica, the forum, and baths, as well as some of the most lavish homes decorated with frescoes and mosaics. One of the most unusual buildings is the Lupanar, a brothel containing rudimentary stone beds as well as frescoes with erotic images. Many of the archaeological remains, including many of the bodies buried under layers of ash, are preserved in the Horrea and Olitorium. Visitors will be able to see how the citizens would cross the roads using enormous stone crosswalks so that they wouldn\u2019t get muddy. Heart-stirring Pompeii was a fascinating city and it's surprising to find it so well preserved. The town seems to still be inhabited since most of the buildings are just as they were when the volcano erupted. Even the paintings, frescoes, and other decorative elements of the houses are intact. Probably one of the most hair-raising parts of the visit\u00a0is the display of the victims of the explosion, which depicts the terror they felt seconds before dying. Getting to Pompeii The three main ways to get to Pompeii from Rome are: Booking a guided tour : This is the easiest way of getting to Pompeii. It includes a hotel pickup, transport there and back, a guided tour in English, admission tickets, and food. Train : To get to Pompeii by train\u00a0visitors will have to take a train from Termini station to Naples, and once there, take the Circumvesuviana line to Pompei i . It can take between 2 and 3 hours to get there. The price can vary from \u20ac 30 and \u20ac 100 for a return trip, depending on the train you choose to take. Car rental : This is the cheapest option if you\u2019re traveling with friends or family. However, keep in mind the price of the tolls, petrol and the time it takes to hire a car. We recommend this option to those who want to rent a car to visit other nearby cities .
